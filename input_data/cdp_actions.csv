The bikeways will create an easy movement of people into, out of and around the city and needs to be well-planned and achieve a balance between the full suite of transport options including cars, public transport, cycling and walking. Part of this partnership is to ensure a future for South Australia that is sustainable, responds to environmental change and works toward becoming one of the world’s first carbon neutral cities. In addition to improving walking and cycling routes, the City of Adelaide, together with Bike SA, runs ‘Adelaide Free Bikes’ – which provides over 200 bikes for daily hire from over 20 locations in the city.

Adelaide	Australia	South Asia and Oceania	Finance and Economic Development		Instruments to fund low carbon projects		2017	"South Australia is experiencing an increase in the frequency, intensity and duration of heat waves. As energy prices continue to rise, vulnerable and low income members of the community are often forced to consider whether they are able to afford the energy costs associated with air conditioning. An increase in heat waves can pose significant health and financial impacts for households that are trying to maintain healthy indoor temperatures. There are several barriers to the installation of solar PV systems for low income and rental households. These include access to upfront capital to purchase and install the solar PV systems; lack of clarity and trust in the solar market; and a split incentive between landlords and tenants, where landlords pay for the solar PV systems, while the tenant benefits from its installation. The Solar Savers Adelaide Program was designed in an attempt to overcome some of these barriers and to encourage the increased uptake of solar PV in residences within the City of Adelaide. Solar Savers Adelaide involves the City of Adelaide providing up front funding for the purchase and installation of solar photovoltaic (PV) energy systems on eligible low-income and rental residential properties. Participating properties will have a ~2kW solar PV energy system installed on their property and Council will recover the costs from participating property owners for facilitating the supply and installation of the solar PV systems through a separate rate charge."

When an application is submitted, the Traffic, Pedestrian, and  Bicycle Safety Committee already evaluates traffic counts, circulation, efficiency, speed, and safety. It does not currently evaluate any increase or decrease in GHG emissions as a result of stop sign installation or removal.A typical vehicle always burns some amount of fuel when the engine is on, even when the vehicle is not moving (idling), although modern vehicles use much less fuel when idling than in motion. Since burning fuel releases air pollutants and GHGs, cutting down on idling time can help improve air quality and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Stop signs result in idling, so when examining whether to add or remove a stop sign, it is important to look at the emissions that would result.*reductions that could be avoided if committee voted 'no' to a new stop sign; estimated reductions are per stop sign installed assuming at least 300 vehicles pass through the intersection (minimum required if a new stop sign is installed)."

The systematic planning and provision of public amenities such as trail facilities, recreation equipment, play fields for organized sports, swimming facilities, parkways, schools, churches, day care facilities, parks and shopping opportunities at the neighborhood or community-scale is its central theme.In summer 2006, the City of Columbia initiated a visioning process known as “Imagine Columbia’s Future.” The Final Vision and Action Plan (Vision Report) was issued in 2007 and accepted by the City Council in February 2008. One of the action items in the Vision Report suggested revising planning and zoning ordinances to align with the goals and issues identified during the visioning process. City Council approved a Vision Implementation Report committing city staff and the Planning and Zoning Commission to issue a set of recommendations for a new comprehensive plan and modernization of the City development codes by the end of fiscal year 2011."

EnerGuide Assessment and Labelling Program for Residential Buildings: The purpose of this project is to inspire Edmontonians to improve energy efficiency in new and existing homes through the introduction of energy labels that provide information about home energy performance. The desired outcome is to make the EnerGuide label for homes a market norm in Edmonton that attributes value to energy efficiency. This new information is expected to drive energy efficiency improvements in existing homes (through energy efficiency renovations) and in new homes (by increasing consumer demand for energy efficiency). Initially the programs will be voluntary - focused on market champions. This will expand to a City-wide, “opt-in” disclosure program and eventually lead to a City requirement/bylaw. This project aligns with the federal government’s recently released Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate that states: Federal, provincial, and territorial governments will work together with the aim of requiring labelling of building energy use by as early as 2019. Labelling will provide consumers and businesses with transparent information on energy performance. Given the federal government’s signal that regulation are coming, the focus of Edmonton’s program will be to develop a robust voluntary program that supports capacity-building and community participation prior to the regulation coming into effect.  Key efforts to year-end 2016 included: (1) development of a value case for the program, (2)  a contest that awarded EnerGuide audits to 25 Edmonton homeowners in order for the City to learn more about the new EnerGuide rating system and the energy performance of Edmonton’s residential building stock, (3) development of a web-based mapping tool showing the location of contest-winner homes and those of participating builders along with their EnerGuide scores and (4) a video explaining and promoting the EnerGuide program Edmonton’s EnerGuide for Homes: Spot the Difference Next Steps: In Q1, 2017 an approach known as human centered design  will be applied in collaboration with the Government of Alberta and Natural Resources Canada to further understand homeowner behaviour and inform the pilot project design.

Large Building Energy Reporting and Disclosure Program: The purpose of this project is to collect accurate, annual information on whole building energy performance across Edmonton’s large building stock, including commercial, light industrial, municipal, institutional, mixed-use, and multi-unit residential buildings (i.e., for the purpose of this project,  large buildings are defined as those greater than 20,000 square feet). The information will be used to benchmark building energy performance across Edmonton’s large buildings and direct energy efficiency improvements in those buildings through the creation of an information-action feedback loop with program participants. The pilot project will be rolled out in stages. In year-one (2017), building owners in Edmonton will be invited to participate in a voluntary pilot where they can choose to report their energy usage for the 2016 calendar year. Many municipally-owned buildings will participate – demonstrating the City’s commitment to lead-by-example. The long-term objective is to increase the number of buildings participating in the program until nearly all large buildings within Edmonton city limits are participating annually.  As with the EnerGuide labelling program for homes (above), this project is influenced by the Federal Government’s recent announcement (in the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change) – that energy reporting and disclosure for buildings will be regulated nationwide as early as 2019. As a result, this project will focus on preparing Edmonton’s large building sector for the new regulations that are coming and use Edmonton’s experience to influence the national/provincial program that will emerge.Key efforts to year-end 2016 included: (1) significant completion of a value case for the program (compiling theoretical and practical evidence for the program, including an Edmonton building stock analysis and modelling to understand the benefits that can be reasonably expected from the program), (2) building external stakeholder understanding and support for the program (with BOMA Edmonton seen as a key stakeholders) and (3) ensuring strong participation of City-owned buildings/facilities. Next Steps: Design workshops will be conducted with internal and external stakeholders in Q1, 2017 including the examination of opportunities to align this project with complementary provincial programs.

Community Energy Consumption Information Platform: The purpose of this project is to establish an information and analytical tool that will: (a) help citizens understand their personal energy use and actions they can take to conserve and use energy more efficiently, and (b) help City policy makers and program managers understand where and how energy is being used in Edmonton (in order to target energy conservation and efficiency opportunities). The web-based platform that is envisioned will be a place where a large majority of Edmontonians will go to better understand the energy performance of buildings where they work, live and play. This user-friendly environment will allow building owners and occupants to quickly increase their understanding of the electricity, natural gas, water and transportation-related energy consumption by building, street, postal code, neigbourhood and/or city sub-region. Based on building age, size, number of occupants, location and other factors, the system will provide feedback to owners on how the building compares to: (a) buildings of a similar size/age in Edmonton, (b) buildings constructed to the current Model National Energy Code, and (c) other benchmarks that will be helpful to them in understanding building performance. Based on this analysis, the system will be further designed to provide site-specific advice on possible areas of improvement and next steps that building owners can take. The site will be designed to entice regular return visits by providing regular updates of information (at least quarterly), offering incentives and promotions on various devices that improve energy efficiency in buildings, and by providing information and learning opportunities.In 2016, the City of Edmonton hosted a number of stakeholder meetings (involving representatives from EPCOR, ATCO Gas, Enmax, Province of Alberta, Municipal Climate Change Action Centre, City of Calgary and City of Edmonton) to explore the potential for such a platform. Generally, stakeholders expressed strong support for the concept and interest in working together to explore possible solutions. As a first step, the City conducted a request for information (RFI) in April 2016 (followed by a supplemental RFI in August 2016) to obtain advice from proponents on the range of possible solutions and products.  Seven proponents responded, acknowledging the need and value of such a platform and offering a range of advice.  Based on this information, it was concluded that justification existed to proceed with a request for proposals (RFP) for a web-based platform that would be externally owned and operated. However, the RFP did not proceed in 2016 as one of the participating utility companies requested time to evaluate the possibility of it providing the platform.  In the end, they decided the timing was not right to lead such an effort. Next Steps: The City of Edmonton has resumed its leadership role, in close collaboration with the aforementioned stakeholder, to further evaluate options, including the possibility of a RFP or a pilot project in 2017."

Streamlining the Solar PV Permitting Process: The purpose of this project is to establish a permitting process for building-mounted solar PV systems that will streamline the existing approval process and provide clarity on building safety requirements, allowable impacts to adjacent properties, and allowable exemptions.The scope of this project allowed for the possibility of residential solar PV projects being exempt from development permit requirements (as is the case in a number of Canadian and U.S. cities). While residential solar PV projects in Edmonton are not required to obtain building permits currently, they are required to submit design and installation drawings (stamped by a professional engineer) for City review. This process has raised concern amongst clients relative to project delays, increased costs, uncertainty about approval criteria, and the overall value of the review. Next Steps: A legal review to determine the appropriate level of City involvement in the review of residential solar PV projects (from a structural safety perspective) will be completed in Q1, 2017. The draft land-use amendment (re: building-mounted solar PV systems) will be presented to City Council in Q2, 2017."	CDP			43912	1220

Valley Line LRT and LRT Expansion Projects: The purpose of these projects is to build an LRT system that is an efficient and environmentally friendly way to move Edmontonians. As the LRT and supporting bus network expands, high quality, high-capacity transit travel will be available to an increasing number of destinations, thereby increasing the attractiveness of the system to users.In June 2009, City Council adopted a long-term LRT Network Plan that defines the future size, scale and style of the regional LRT system. Eventually, the LRT network will have six lines extending to the northwest, northeast, east, southeast, south and west.The Valley Line LRT (Stage 1: Mill Woods to Downtown) is an urban-style, low-floor LRT currently that began construction in 2016 and is scheduled for completion in December 2020. The 13.1km line is being built at a capital cost of approximately $1.8 billion (2016 CAD) which will feature: o	11 fully accessible, community-integrated stops, designed with a minimal infrastructure footprinto	Davies station, which includes a full Park & Ride and transit centre o	The new Tawatinâ bridge spanning the North Saskatchewan River o	A short tunnel from the Quarters redevelopment to Louise McKinney Parko	An interchange at Churchill Square linking to the Capital and Metro LRT linesEven as the Valley Line project progresses, preparations are underway for the construction of several other LRT expansions, including:o	The Metro Line, extending northwest from Blatchford to city limits near St. Alberto	The Capital Line, extending south from Century Park to Heritage Valley, and northeast from Clareview to Gormano	The Valley Line, extending west from Downtown to Lewis Farmso	A future ‘central area circulator’ is also in the early stages of planning.LRT development promotes many City initiatives from The Ways encouraging efficient energy use, including:o	Promoting mode shift: Moving more people more efficiently in fewer vehicles, and encouraging more active forms of transportation.o	Promoting a compact urban form: Creating denser development around LRT stations and transit centres, reducing the length of vehicle trips and infrastructure expenditure.o	Promoting green transit: Building out a transit system that is environmentally sustainable and reduces greenhouse gasses and energy consumption."

Blatchford Redevelopment: The purpose of this project is to transform 535 acres in the heart of Edmonton into one of the world’s largest sustainable communities. The neighbourhood will create an opportunity for 30,000 residents to live a unique and sustainable lifestyle. Driven by City Council’s vision to create a community that significantly reduces its ecological footprint and empowers residents to pursue sustainable lifestyle choices, Blatchford is a leading-by-example opportunity to showcase Edmonton’s commitment to becoming an energy sustainable city. The community will incorporate best practices for sustainable urban design including increasing density; prioritizing design that promotes walking, cycling or transit; creating a mix of housing, retail, commercial and public spaces; and incorporating significant park and green spaces. On December 8, 2016, City Council approved the community energy strategy, including the framework for a renewable energy utility that will further reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enable the effective use of energy. The plan relies on the following three strategies:o	Conservation: All buildings in Blatchford will incorporate green building features to reduce the amount of energy required.o	Efficiency: An ambient district energy sharing system (DESS) will provide heating, cooling and domestic hot water for the buildings in Blatchford. It will be capable of sharing energy between buildings, neighbourhoods and seasons, significantly reducing overall energy demand. o	Renewables: The use of on-site renewable energy sources including geo-exchange, solar PV and sewer heat exchange.Next Steps: After years of necessary planning, design, engineering and site preparation work, construction for the first residential stage and a section of the central park starts in spring 2017.

Edmonton Transit Service (ETS) Electric Buses: Over the past three years, ETS and Fleet and Facility Services have worked towards introducing battery-powered electric buses (e-bus) into its regular service fleet. This is part of the City’s commitment to exploring emerging technologies to create a more effective, efficient and ecologically responsible public transit service for Edmontonians. The first pilot project was conducted between May and October of 2014, testing two electric buses on Edmonton streets. In winter 2015/16, field trials showed that e-buses will operate effectively on Edmonton roads and throughout winter months. In June 2016, Administration provided a report to City Council outlining the results of winter testing and a business case for an initial deployment of 40 e-buses. The analysis indicates that e-buses is a cost neutral alternative to diesel buses. Based on present electricity generation in Alberta, it is estimated that an e-bus emits approximately 38 to 44 per cent less CO2 emissions than its diesel counterpart.Next Steps: City Council has directed Administration to purchase up to 40 e-buses, with funding available through the Public Transit Infrastructure Fund (PTIF). A request for proposals will be issued in the second quarter of 2017, with delivery of buses expected in late 2018/early 2019. Administration is undertaking other activities to plan for e-bus deployment in Edmonton, including:o	Change management activities, ensuring staff is trained to operate and maintain the new technology, and facilities and processes are in place to support e-bus operations,o	Facility assessments to determine the feasibility and costs of upgrading transit garages to equip e-buses, and o	Developing a longer term acquisition and deployment strategy for the next capital budget cycle in 2019."

Update of the City (corporate) Operations GHG Inventory: The purpose of this project is to: (1) establish a short-term plan for achieving the 2018 Corporate Measure – Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions in City (corporate) Operations, (2) establish a ten-year plan (2019-2028) for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in City (corporate) operations, and (3) establish a corporate management and accountability framework for guiding the implementation and ongoing maintenance of these two plans. The current City (corporate) Operations GHG Management Plan was approved by Corporate Leadership Team in 2012. It sets an ambitious goal to reduce GHG emissions by 50% by 2020 (compared to 2008 levels). The reason the plan requires updating at this time is because a number of its key assumptions are obsolete – particularly those relating to infrastructure growth and the amounts of green power that would be purchased in this timeframe. Because the City is not on track to achieve the 2018 Corporate Target (in the red) there is need for action to fully understand the situation, evaluate possible corrective actions and report back to City Council with an updated plan. At year-end 2016, the project charter for this project had been drafted and submitted to the executive sponsors for approval.Next Steps: The project will commence in early 2017 with: (1) a report to City Council in summer 2017 detailing a short-term plan for achieving the 2018 Corporate Target, and (2) a second report to City Council in December 2017 outlining a ten-year plan and accountability framework."

After receiving notification that its application was unsuccessful, Administration brought back a second report to Executive Committee on November 22, 2016 (CR_4178) recommending an electric vehicle charging station pilot project called Plug’n Go Edmonton that would fund the installation of 100 publicly-accessible Level 2 charging stations: 30 at City-owned facilities and 70 at privately owned facilities. It was intended that the pilot project would inform the development of Edmonton’s Electric Vehicle Strategy, including: (1) creating public awareness to encourage the uptake of electric vehicles, (2) understanding the relationship between electric vehicle purchases in Edmonton and the need for public charging station support, (3) evaluating the overall operational efficiency and effectiveness of Level 2 charging stations in Edmonton’s winter climate, and (4) understanding the potential effectiveness of different ownership and partnership models.In response to Council Report CR_4178, Executive Committee recommended the approval of capital funding for 30 electric vehicle charging stations on City-owned property. However, it did not approve funding for the 70 stations on private property. Instead, it requested that private ownership models be further explored when developing Edmonton’s Electric Vehicle Strategy. As well, Council postponed the decision on the capital funding for the 30 City-owned charging stations to April 2017.Next Steps: Fleet and Facility Services Branch will prepare a business case for the acquisition of electric vehicles to replace some of the existing light duty City fleet.

Through a partnership between the Downtown District, BG Group and Houston First Corporation, the downtown community can utilize the environmentally-friendly buses to get to popular downtown locations quickly.  The buses run on Compressed Natural Gas (CNG), making them a cleaner transportation alternative.  Greenlink is operated by METRO through an interlocal agreement with the Downtown District.  This is a pilot program utilizing a CNG bus, and METRO is looking to expand its fleet with more CNG buses.In March 2015, with the delivery of fifty 40-foot New Flyer Xcelsior CNG buses scheduled for the spring and an additional 150 to be delivered in 2016, METRO, the transit agency serving the city of Houston and most of surrounding Harris County, executed an agreement that will have Freedom Fuel PBP (Freedom CNG) supply CNG to fuel the transit agency’s CNG rolling stock. The fueling agreement is valued at a not-to-exceed price of $5.5 million with a three-year term, with an option to extend the fueling contract for an additional three years. The fueling station was operational in September 2015, and Freedom built that CNG station adjacent to METRO’s bus operations and support facility at 303 Fallbrook Drive in Houston, where in addition to fueling the buses, Freedom CNG will offer public access fueling to commercial fleets and passenger vehicles. Freedom CNG is building the station in collaboration with CenterPoint Energy Services. METRO will fuel its New Flyer CNGs at a public CNG station until the Freedom station is opened.METRO ordered the New Flyer CNG buses in September 2013, part of an order for 265 40-foot buses that also included diesel buses. The transit agency had tested four NatGas buses a decade ago but found them too costly to operate. Instead, METRO focused on deploying a diesel-electric hybrid bus fleet, and today about 35 percent of the 1,250 buses in METRO’s fleet are diesel-hybrids, according to AFV Intelligence’s North American Transit Agency Bus Census and Alternative Fuels Digest."

Six elements serve as the lynchpins in the development of the blueprint of Miami: Zoning (Miami 21 Zoning Code), Economic Development, Historic Preservation, Parks and Open Spaces, Arts and Culture, and Transportation. Miami 21 instituted a number of programs for sustainability that were adopted into the Code of the City of Miami. Under Miami 21, the City Code requires all new buildings of more than 50,000 square feet of habitable Rooms and habitable Space in certain zones to be at a minimum certified as Silver by the USGBC LEED standards or equivalent standards adopted or approved by the City. Incentives exist for Gold and Platinum certification and also for properties below 50,000 square feet achieving LEED or equivalent certification. The initiatives require a fee payment schedule based on square footage of building: 50,000 - 100,000 sf = 2% of construction cost; 100,000 - 200,000 sf = 3% of construction cost; and > 200,000 sf = 4% of construction cost.

This will be achieved by, among other things:  - Make  charging stations available in the city's parking garages.  - Introducing charging stations outside selected municipal buildings for the use of guests and staff.  - The City of Reykjavík working with Reykjavík Energy to garner ideas for introducing charging stations within the city's districts.  - Putting forth a plan of action detailing how city buses and the prospective Public Transportation Corridor can be entirely powered by energy sources free from green house gas emissions.  - Examining the code of conduct regulating the city and its businesses in order to dispel obstacles against electric transport and ease its implementation.City of Reykjavík aims to reduce transport needs while putting an emphasis on on line  services for individuals, families and businesses. Priority will be given to either bringing the availability of leisure activities and other on line services as close to users' domiciles as possible, or by making sure they are easily accessible within each city district through the use of eco-friendly modes of transport by choosing their location as well as the arrangement of public transport and by creating to a city-wide district plan.A plan will be put into action for reducing traffic and shortening distances when it comes to the transport of construction materials. An increase in sea transport is one possibility. For these purposes an environmental evaluation will be put together on the possibility of further quarrying and extracting of minerals in Geldinganes.The aim is to make electrical charging for ships and vessels available at Faxaflóahafnir (Associated Icelandic Ports). For this the co-operation of other governments, energy sale companies and other harbours will be sought after.Implementing Smart city solutions  of buildings and city infrastructures in order to implement energy savings and reduce resource waste, this will be done in co-operation with Félagsbústaðir (Reykjavík Social Hosting) and other stakeholders."

It sets out the potential reduction in levels of domestic, commercial and industrial waste going to landfill as non-recycled waste as well as the portion of renewable energy that could be produced by the City’s community domestic, commercial and industrial waste. Rather than replacing recycling, the City’s draft plan calls for a facility that could recover the energy resource remaining in waste after the best recycling efforts have been undertaken.

Bureaux/departments have been advised to strengthen energy saving efforts such as appointing green managers/wardens and adopting green housekeeping measures.  All new government buildings should aim to outperform the Code of Practice for Energy Efficiency of Building Services Installation (the “Building Energy Code” or “BEC”) by 3% to 10%.The Government has also been leading by example in implementing energy saving programmes within Government departments. The Government has taken the lead to set specific electricity reduction targets for Government buildings since 2003.  We have already achieved an energy saving of over 15% over the past decade.  On top of this, the Government has set the target of 5% saving in the electricity consumption of government buildings from 2015/16 to 2019/20 under comparable operating conditions in 2013/14.  To achieve this target, a series of measures have been introduced, including the conduct of energy audits for about 350 major government buildings with comparatively high annual electricity consumption to identify energy management opportunities.  At least HK$500 million has been earmarked to gradually implement electricity saving projects identified in the energy audits in the next five years starting in Financial Year 2017/18.

The city is guided by the Clean Air Asia’s avoid, shift and improve strategies to implement the sustainable urban transport programs.Consultation improves the quality of rules, programs, compliance and reduces enforcement costs for both government and citizens. Regulation and its reforms affect all the participants in civil society, and therefore, in order to better assess the impacts and minimize costs, all the parties involved should be able to participate somehow in the regulatory processes. That is why public consultation has become one of the best tools to improve quality in regulating Pasig City roads. - Promote active transport of walking, jogging and biking- Implemented and sustained in five major roads for five years - 185,000 visitors/ Carless loyalists- 360 events/ activities- Air-quality improvement by 72%- Promotes entrepreneurship, bazaars/ business- Promote family and community bonding spiritBayanihan sa Daan.Inculcating the values of family and community bonding as well as road sharing principles. The City continue to create many places for people to assemble, play and associate with others within their neighborhood despite the limited urban space, thus innovating carless sunday streets, pedestrianization and all forms of non-motorized transportation.Difficulties and Challenges include the business sector questioning the legality of road closure and institutionalize Carless Sunday Streets – the City Government invoked the stakeholders engagement and bike ordinance as well as Executive Order 774 favoring “non-motorized transportation and that those who have less in wheels must have more in roads”.With all these soft and hard programs, Pasig City is a recipient of the Bayanihan sa Daan Awards for 2014 and 2015 held at Malacañang Palace as well as one of the ASEANModel Cities Award as an Environmentally Sustainable City not to mention the International Liveable Community Awards for the Share the Road Program.""

Um das novidades da lei é a criação da figura do grande gerador doméstico e comercial: aquele que gera acima de 200 litros ou 120 quilos-dia de resíduos sólidos urbanos. Abaixo desse volume estão os pequenos geradores domésticos e comerciais. Estes, assim como os grandes geradores domésticos, continuam sendo atendidos pelo serviço público de coleta.Já os grandes geradores comerciais, por sua vez, deverão implantar serviços próprios de coleta, transporte, separação e destinação final dos resíduos de forma independente do serviço público, assumindo, inclusive, os custos desse processo.Também deverão providenciar postos de entrega voluntária para recebimento de recicláveis e resíduos especiais entregues pelos clientes do estabelecimento, com o objetivo de aumentar a reciclagem e o reaproveitamento de matérias primas. É o caso, por exemplo, das lâmpadas.Grandes geradores comerciais e domésticos ficam obrigados a comprovar junto à Secretaria de Meio Ambiente (Semam), a destinação final ambientalmente adequada dos resíduos sólidos gerados.O aumento na reciclagem representa uma redução no consumo de recursos naturais, como água, metais e madeira, entre outros. “Com essa nova legislação, Santos reforça, junto à sociedade, o entendimento de que boa parte do que descartamos é, na verdade, matéria prima."

Sertãozinho	Brazil	Latin America	Private Transport		Improve fuel economy and reduce CO2 from motorized vehicles		2017	"O município de Sertãozinho participa anualmente do programa “município verde azul” da Secretaria de Meio Ambiente do Estado de São Paulo, que visa conceitos e práticas voltadas a sustentabilidade das cidades paulistas.Dentro desse programa existem 10 Diretivas, tais como: Gestão da água, qualidade do ar, arborização urbana, esgoto tratado, resíduos sólidos, dentre outras.Na Diretiva Qualidade do ar, o Municipio realiza através da Lei nº 6006/2015 e sua regulamentação Decreto nº 6438, vistorias periódicas em todos os veículos a diesel da frota municipal e terceirizada, medido através da escala Ringelmann. Os veículos reprovados são encaminhados para a manutenção, a fim de diminuir o nível de fumaça, e voltarem a circular pelo município.Visando sempre a melhoria continua no combate á emissões de poluentes a Secretaria do Meio Ambiente de Sertãozinho, investe na compra do composto Quimico Arla 32, responsável pela diminuição de até 80% de materiais particulados e até 60% da emissão do NOx (Gás Óxido de Nitrogênio) SOx (Óxido Sulfidrico) CO2  (Óxidos de Carbono) CO (Monoxido de Carbono).Esse gás interfere diretamente nas trocas gasosas das folhas, prejudicando diretamente a fotossintese das plantas, além de prejudicar á saúde do ser humano, esse gás tóxico gera também as chuvas ácidas elas afetam tanto as construções, a agricultura quanto a saúde do ser humano também.A partir do ano de 2012 as montadoras vêm englobando em suas frotas de caminhões e ônibus a diesel o catalizador, onde é adicionado o composto químico Arla 32, que manda esse composto para o escapamento, ele funciona como um filtro, evitando que o escapamento do veículo emita os gases e as partículas para a atmosfera.Outro fator relevante é que a Prefeitura Municipal exige em contrato que as frotas Tercerizadas, de empresas prestadoras de serviço seja igual ou inferior á dez (10) anos, diminuindo assim o índice de poluição desses veículosAtravés da Lei Complementar nº 274/2011 que veda a realização de queimadas no município, o município realiza fiscalizações e penaliza os infratores, evitando os índices de queimada do município."

This will enhance our existing and planned mitigation efforts under our Climate Action Plan, and stimulate clean technology and market innovation. The carbon tax will generally be applied upstream, for example, on power stations and other large direct emitters. For stationary emissions, the government is looking at a proposed threshold of 25,000 tCO2e of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions annually. The Singapore government is looking at a tax rate of around S$10 and S$20 per tonne of carbon dioxide-equivalent GHG emissions (S$10-20/tCO2e).

The preliminary numbers for the 2016 inventory suggest that the community is at 12% reductions below the 2005 baseline.  The City has built an in-house model and developed initiative level project charters to assess the GHG and financial return of all initiatives with confidence. Fort Collins is aligning the commitment to decarbonization with its energy policy, Road to Zero Waste goals, and long-range land use, transportation and transit planning. In the last decade, the community has doubled its transit ridership and is a designated Platinum bicycle city.  Fort Collins was an early adopter of Pay as You Throw and recently passed a new Recycling Ordinance, achieving a 58% diversion rate from the landfill. The community has increased its solar power capacity 3.5 times since adopting the goals, which included a highly publicized community solar garden that will provide access to renewable energy benefits to 20-25 families every year over the next 25 years, reaching at least 500 low income families. Our award-winning ClimateWise program has engaged over 400 businesses and reduced more than 1.3 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent, saving over $93 million, since its inception. Fort Collins was also the smallest jurisdiction ever selected to participate in the City Energy Project and was invited to apply, despite not meeting the typical population threshold, because of its demonstrated leadership and ability to ‘punch above its weight class.’"	CDP			54066	1576

Through the strategy development process, priority areas for action have been identified, each of which has one or more actions attached. These are high-level, strategic actions, which through the implementation process may need to be broken down into more detailed actions. As the action plan is implemented, timescales will be assigned to the actions as appropriate. The action plan is a working document which will be reviewed and updated on an annual basis by the Dorset Energy Group and its associated working groups.

The actions are currently embedded within the Bournemouth Poole and Dorset Energy Efficiency Action Plan pdf document. The Priority Areas for Action are as follows:

Overarching Priority Areas for Bournemouth:

Lahti	Finland		Energy Supply		Low or zero carbon energy supply generation		2016	"80% of Lahti's buildings are connected to distric heating system. So how that energy is created, effects greatly how much GHG emissions will be emitted from the city-wide area. The largest emission reduction targets are in distric heating system, -56 000 tons CO2_ekv (1990-2020). However, at the same time use of electricity is estimated to increase (despite better energy-effiency and green electricity) by 8000 t CO2_ekv. 
Kymijärvi II is the first gasification power plant in the world to efficiently generate electricity and district heat from Solid Recovered Fuel. Its commercial use started on May 2012. The city-owned Lahti Energy Ltd. plans to build new CHP plant would be able to burn a wide range of fuels, including biomass, coal, peat, RDF and natural gas. The plant could burn up to a million tonnes of biomass per year.  It would replace the ageing Kymijärvi I power plant fired mostly on coal. This Bio2020 power plant plays the key role on Lahti’s path to its challenging GHG emission targets set into year 2025.

Bicycle transport, observed from many aspects, by all means represents a transport mode that should be especially stimulated and promoted in urban settlements. Aiming at more comprehensive utilization of its potentials it will be necessary to provide necessary conditions, primarily through implementation of adequate infrastructure. City has started build of new and continuous maintenance of cycling paths in the city area. As inevitable ancillary facilities, we would produce and place the billboards with maps of the marked cycling paths, as well as the garages in the rush sites of the city. Within this set of measures, setting of the network of stations for renting bicycles was recognized as especially stimulating method, which would make users' movements much easier and enable their substantial mobility. An important segment of the given set of measures will also be intense promotional activities directed to stimulating use of bicycle transport,. According to the experiences, implementation of this set of measures in the ten year period would indirectly reduce the fuel consumption of private and commercial vehicles by 3%, which is 116 TJ"	CDP			58569	1242

Benicia	USA		Private Transport		Transportation demand management		2016	"Updating the Stop Sign Warrant application is a simple, no-cost action that can bring attention to emissions related to installing or removing a stop sign in Benicia. 

When an application is submitted, the Traffic, Pedestrian, and  Bicycle Safety Committee already evaluates traffic counts, circulation, efficiency, speed, and safety. It does not currently evaluate any increase or decrease in GHG emissions as a result of stop sign installation or removal.

A typical vehicle always burns some amount of fuel when the engine is on, even when the vehicle is not moving (idling), although modern vehicles use much less fuel when idling than in motion. Since burning fuel releases air pollutants and GHGs, cutting down on idling time can help improve air quality and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Stop signs result in idling, so when examining whether to add or remove a stop sign, it is important to look at the emissions that would result.

*reductions that could be avoided if committee voted 'no' to a new stop sign; estimated reductions are per stop sign installed assuming at least 300 vehicles pass through the intersection (minimum required if a new stop sign is installed)."	CDP			49787	1184

Property owners pay for the improvements over time and the repayment obligation transfers automatically to the next owner if the property is sold. Similar to a sewer tax assessment, capital provided under the PACE program is secured by a lien on the property, so low-interest capital can be raised from the private sector with no government financing required."

In November 2012, the City launched the Urban Grows initiative.  Urban Grows, part of the City of Houston’s Healthy Houston initiative, aims to help communities build vegetable gardens, farms and orchards on vacant land in areas with poor access to healthy fresh foods, often referred to as food deserts.  The City of Houston will provide lots through its LARA program (Land Assemblage Redevelopment Authority), which works to redevelop tax-delinquent and abandoned properties.  Community members, partnering with local non-profits, foundations or churches, will then work to transform these vacant lots into usable, productive and attractive green spaces.  Urban Grows is the first initiative launched as part of Mayor Parker’s new program, Healthy Houston, which is designed to reduce obesity and increase healthy eating and exercise. Healthy Houston will promote programs, policies and actions designed to reduce food deserts, promote the availability of locally-grown foods, encourage the development of sustainable food systems and promote recreational opportunities.

Urban Grows will:
 
• Encourage urban agriculture in neighborhoods, utilizing vacant City property
• Improve access to healthy, affordable and locally produced food for all neighborhoods
• Support education regarding the benefits of sustainable agriculture 
 
Urban Grows will complement the City’s existing efforts, including the launch of the City Hall Farmers Market and farmers markets at the City’s multi-service centers; new vegetable container gardens downtown and throughout the City; and a Grocery Access Task Force that works with grocers on providing economic tools and incentives to help spur more supermarket and grocery development in areas where they are needed."

Through a partnership between the Downtown District, BG Group and Houston First Corporation, the downtown community can utilize the environmentally-friendly buses to get to popular downtown locations quickly.  The buses run on Compressed Natural Gas (CNG), making them a cleaner transportation alternative.  Greenlink is operated by METRO through an interlocal agreement with the Downtown District.  This is a pilot program utilizing a CNG bus, and METRO is looking to expand its fleet with more CNG buses.

In March 2015, with the delivery of fifty 40-foot New Flyer Xcelsior CNG buses scheduled for the spring and an additional 150 to be delivered in 2016, METRO, the transit agency serving the city of Houston and most of surrounding Harris County, executed an agreement that will have Freedom Fuel PBP (Freedom CNG) supply CNG to fuel the transit agency’s CNG rolling stock. The fueling agreement is valued at a not-to-exceed price of $5.5 million with a three-year term, with an option to extend the fueling contract for an additional three years. The fueling station was operational in September 2015, and Freedom built that CNG station adjacent to METRO’s bus operations and support facility at 303 Fallbrook Drive in Houston, where in addition to fueling the buses, Freedom CNG will offer public access fueling to commercial fleets and passenger vehicles. Freedom CNG is building the station in collaboration with CenterPoint Energy Services. METRO will fuel its New Flyer CNGs at a public CNG station until the Freedom station is opened.

METRO ordered the New Flyer CNG buses in September 2013, part of an order for 265 40-foot buses that also included diesel buses. The transit agency had tested four NatGas buses a decade ago but found them too costly to operate. Instead, METRO focused on deploying a diesel-electric hybrid bus fleet, and today about 35 percent of the 1,250 buses in METRO’s fleet are diesel-hybrids, according to AFV Intelligence’s North American Transit Agency Bus Census and Alternative Fuels Digest."

The City of Houston is trying to get ahead of transportation challenges. The Houston Planning Commission has established several committees to examine a range of development and growth issues. One of the committees, the General Plan committee, established mobility and drainage as top priorities and recommended a programmatic framework to address these issues. City Mobility Planning (CMP) will be the framework for evaluating transportation issues in the city and extra-territorial Jurisdiction (ETJ).  Part of the study looked at ways to improve intersections and access to trail networks.

In November, 2012, city voters passed a bond referendum for the Bayou Greenways Initiative. Over the next ten years, the Bayou Greenways will add 4,000 acres of new and equitably distributed green spaces that can also serve the function of flood control and storm water quality enhancement. It will also complete 300 miles of continuous all-weather hike and bike trails that will meander through those greenways — an amenity unparalleled in the nation.  Developing green corridors along the bayous with connected trails bring a smart and sustainable resolution to alleviate the City’s green space and flooding challenges.

Houston	USA		Private Transport		Transportation demand management		2016	"METRO HOT (High Occupancy Toll) Lanes allow drivers without passengers (single-occupant vehicles or SOVs) to use the HOV (High Occupancy Vehicle) Lane – for a toll.

Traffic monitoring systems help METRO maintain traffic speeds to ensure optimal travel times for existing HOV Lane users, as well those using the METRO HOT Lanes. If speeds slow, single-occupant vehicles are not allowed in the HOV Lane. The lane is also be closed during peak traffic periods – specific to each METRO HOT Lane corridor - to single-occupant vehicles.

METRO HOT Lanes benefits:
-Provides new options for commuters
-Increases safety and promotes quick response to accidents and issues in the lanes, thanks to additional camera monitoring
-Improves air quality by reducing traffic congestion
-Better utilizes existing HOV Lanes
-Offers increased enforcement of the HOV Lane system
-Revenue generated from tolls will contribute to the operation, maintenance and enforcement costs for METRO HOT Lanes

Tolls are based on time of day and the congestion level of each METRO HOT Lane. METRO will publish the toll rate for specific corridors prior to opening, and tolls will be prominently displayed along each corridor.

""Managed lanes"" refers to a mixed-use facility dedicated to mass transit, high occupancy vehicles (HOV), and also allows for tolling. In this case, METRO vehicles are granted free usage 24-hours a day, and HOVs are granted free usage in both directions of travel during peak times-Monday through Friday, 5am - 11am and 2pm - 8pm.  Single occupancy vehicles (SOV) are allowed to use the lanes 24 hours a day for a toll, which will be charged electronically via an EZ TAG or other interoperable Texas toll payment tag.  During HOV hours, drivers will need to choose their designated lane based on the occupancy of their vehicle. Rates are posted on message boards at all entrances. The lanes serve as an all-electronic tollway for all vehicles (except mass transit) during all other times.  In order to maintain an optimum level of service on the facility at all times, toll rates for the managed lanes are based on time of day, vehicle occupancy and axle count.

One Bin for All would allow residents to discard all materials in one bin, treating trash as valuable assets, dramatically increasing recycling using game changing technologies.

Houston will apply proven technologies and new processes, redefining municipal solid waste from a liability to a valuable asset. This first-of-its-kind innovation uses technology in a way that has never been done before. This approach has the potential for cities across the globe to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, save money and create high value materials.

Proven technologies (shredders, sensors, density separators and optical scanners) have been used previously in the waste, mining,

Top Initiatives Include:
Analysis and action plan for each clean tech industry:	
Creating national and perhaps global competitive advantage for the clean tech industries in Portland requires the active engagement of each of the industries. Portland Development Commission (PDC) is convening thought-leaders from each industry as a first step in a process to identify opportunities and barriers in each industry and, ultimately, to develop a strategy to exploit opportunities and remove barriers.
Research and development of eco-districts:	
Eco-districts represent the opportunity to merge Portland’s knowledge in green building with its expertise in urban planning in order to get a head start in developing capabilities in a nascent industry that is likely to grow at a rapid rate in a carbon-constrained economy.
Vestas Expansion Project:	
Vestas, the largest wind turbine manufacturer in the world, has established its North American headquarters in Portland. As demand for energy from renewable sources continues to grow and Portland continues to be recognized as a leader in the wind energy development industry, it is important to assist Vestas with the growth of its headquarters office to maintain this base of expertise in Portland."

The Master Plan shows how this can be achieved, despite significant growth in the economy and new floor space by 2030. This is equivalent to a doubling of energy productivity. The Master Plan includes 11 enabling actions to achieve this target. 

Implementing the Master Plan is the single biggest action the City can take to meet our target of a 70 per cent reduction in carbon emissions by 2030 based on 2006 levels within the local government area. This Plan is cost effective for society and can be acted on immediately.

Environmental upgrade finance also allows the cost of an upgrade to be shared with the tenant. Under the agreement, a building owner may pass on part of the cost of the upgrade to the tenant providing the amount does not exceed the financial saving that the tenant will benefit from as a result of the upgrade. This means that tenants can enjoy the benefits of an environmental upgrade in the short-term and operating cost savings in the long-term.

Sydney	Australia		Waste		Recycling or composting collections and/or facilities		2016	"The Sydney region is facing a waste disposal bottleneck with landfills reaching capacity by 2021 and available waste processing falling well short of demand. The Renewable Energy Master Plan identified that after recycling, the remaining waste generated within the City of Sydney by both residents or businesses could be converted into electricity. The Advanced Waste Treatment Master Plan reviews the technologies available internationally that could achieve this vision. It sets out the potential reduction in levels of domestic, commercial and industrial waste going to landfill as non-recycled waste as well as the portion of renewable energy that could be produced by the City’s community domestic, commercial and industrial waste. Rather than replacing recycling, the City’s draft plan calls for a facility that could recover the energy resource remaining in waste after the best recycling efforts have been undertaken. This would help the City avoid greenhouse gas emissions from waste ending up at landfill, and replace some of the emissions from the use of fossil fuel for energy use."	CDP			31114	1093

Waste education staff has permanently removed up to 35 residential garbage and recycling bins from being stored in City's eastern suburbs by establishing internal waste collection from within the residential apartment buildings in the area. Many of the properties had minimal waste storage areas and coupled with frequent collection meant that bins were often left out on the street attracting illegal dumping and littering. The new internal collection arrangement was the result of extensive stakeholder engagement with the residents, building managers and business owners in the community and has made a dramatic improvement on the amenity of the area.

The City developed and launched an illegal dumping awareness campaign, ‘Want a tip? in November to support its Clean Street program. The campaign set out to increase awareness of the City’s free pick-up service, and also increase the number of bookings generated for the service. ‘Want a tip?’ also informed people that dumping is illegal and that fines can apply."

Sydney	Australia		Waste		Recycling or composting collections and/or facilities		2016	"From April 2011 all domestic waste has been processed at SITA Environmental Solutions Advanced Waste Treatment (AWT) Facilities. This means that none of the City of Sydney’s domestic waste is sent directly to landfill. The City recognises that disposal of untreated waste to landfill is no longer a responsible waste management option. Loss of potential resources and environmental harm arise from methane gas emissions from decomposing garbage. Methane as a greenhouse gas is 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide.

Establishing a treatment facility suitable for energy recovery to further reduce emissions is part of an integrated suite of long term waste solutions being investigated by the City. The aim is to incorporate waste treatment with the City’s Renewable Energy Master Plan."	CDP			31114	790

Hong Kong	Hong Kong		Buildings		Energy efficiency/ retrofit measures		2016	"Implemented the Mandatory Energy Efficiency Labelling Scheme since 2009 which currently covers room air-conditioners, refrigerating appliances, compact fluorescent lamps, dehumidifiers and washing machines.  The energy efficiency grading standards of air conditioners, refrigerators and washing machines were upgraded in October 2014, and full implementation took place in November 2015.  The upgrading exercise can bring about an estimated annual saving of some 300 GWh in electricity consumption with a reduction of about 210 000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emission in Hong Kong.   We have proposed extending the scope of MEELS to cover five more types of electrical appliances, i.e. televisions, washing machines (with a washing capacity of 7kg - 10kg), room air conditioners (heat pump), electric storage water heaters and induction cookers, and intend to introduce legislation to extend the scope of the Scheme within the 2016-17 legislative year."

This consultant-led study, involving significant community outreach and involvement, looked to define goals and objectives for the transit system, what kind of transit services should METRO be providing, and then develop a fiscally-constrained 5-Year Transit Service Plan with both capital and operating components. The newly designed bus system will launch in August 2015.

An important component of METRO's regional mobility plan, Signature Service is based on the successful Bus Rapid Transit model. The result: METRO’s 402 Quickline Bellaire route provides faster travel and fewer stops aboard high-end hybrid vehicles, plus greater reliability and increased customer convenience through the use of integrated technology, infrastructure and operational investments.

This cost-neutral, technological innovation is a paradigm shift, changing how people think about waste and recycling. The concept of “trash” will be extinct and replaced by an understanding that all discarded material has value and can be recycled.

Houston will apply proven technologies and new processes, redefining municipal solid waste from a liability to a valuable asset. This first-of-its-kind innovation uses technology in a way that has never been done before. This approach has the potential for cities across the globe to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, save money and create high value materials.

Houston’s innovation will:
• Provide every residence with curbside One Bin for All services;
• Decrease the volume of waste sent to landfills;
• Reduce air pollution; and,
• Manage waste and recycling costs.

Allowing technology and new process systems to sort household materials and derive an initial 55% diversion rate, and upwards of 75% with composting, anaerobic digestion and catalytic
conversion (biomass-to-fuel) is more efficient and effective. Proven technologies (shredders, sensors, density separators and optical scanners) have been used previously in the waste, mining,

One Bin for All would allow residents to discard all materials in one bin, treating trash as valuable assets, dramatically increasing recycling using game changing technologies.

Houston will apply proven technologies and new processes, redefining municipal solid waste from a liability to a valuable asset. This first-of-its-kind innovation uses technology in a way that has never been done before. This approach has the potential for cities across the globe to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, save money and create high value materials.

Proven technologies (shredders, sensors, density separators and optical scanners) have been used previously in the waste, mining,
or refining industries, but combined in a new process will yield a much higher recycling rate.  This innovation will reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and improve air quality, provide an easy-to-use program for residents, save money and increase revenues.

In the meantime, while One Bin for All is receiving approvals, etc., the City will continue to expand its single-stream recycling program (the bins can be used as the One Bin for the program in the future, so there will be no sunk costs).

• Require bicycle parking for new commercial, retail, and office. Provide incentives that allow for reduced automobile parking up to 10% if additional bicycle parking is provided.
• Expand options within the Shared Parking table to allow more uses to participate in shared parking and expand the time periods, thereby reducing the overall number of parking spaces. Director is given discretion to waive up to 10% of the total number of spaces based upon detailed parking study.
• Establish procedures and criteria to allow areas to create different parking standards, such as reduced parking requirements, expanded distance for off-site parking, or even the removal of parking requirements. These areas are called Special Parking Areas and are the next generation of Parking Management Areas.
• Per requests from the community, the “Warehouse District” on the north side of Downtown has now been included in the Central Business District (CBD) – a district exempt from off-street parking requirements.

During the first four years (to June 2013) the program assisted 366 small to medium sized businesses. Phase III of this program commenced in July 2013 to support medium to large non-office based businesses with an initial focus on the accommodation sector. The program provides hands on sustainability advice and implementation support for water and waste reduction and provides referral to State energy efficiency programs.  
In quarter’s one and two 2014/15, the Smart Green Business Program recruited 79 businesses, completed 68 water and 65 waste audits. A focus on recruitment in quarter one has significantly increased the number of businesses participating in the program. 
During quarter two, one of the program customers, Meriton Serviced Apartments, implemented all water recommendations that had been identified through the audit process across five properties. This has resulted in a 23 per cent reduction in water consumption per annum. These savings will reduce operating costs estimated to be more than $150,000 per annum in total. 
The program is on track to meet or exceed the targets set for this Financial Year. A focus on supporting businesses to implement waste recommendations in quarter two has yielded 2,277 tonnes of waste diverted from landfill. The average operating cost savings made by businesses implementing recommendations is $20,000 per year."	CDP			31114	1549	
Sydney	Australia		Buildings		Energy efficiency/ retrofit measures		2015	"The City’s environmental upgrade finance scheme is part of the NSW Government’s recently introduced Environmental Upgrade Agreements (EUA), which allows councils to enter into agreements with property owners and finance providers in order to fund works aimed at improving the energy, water or environmental efficiency of their building.  Environmental upgrade finance also allows the cost of an upgrade to be shared with the tenant. Under the agreement, a building owner may pass on part of the cost of the upgrade to the tenant providing the amount does not exceed the financial saving that the tenant will benefit from as a result of the upgrade. This means that tenants can enjoy the benefits of an environmental upgrade in the short-term and operating cost savings in the long-term.

The City continues to promote the EUA service and the build capacity of key industry stakeholders and influencers associated with commercial building upgrades. The City continues to work with a building owner and consultants on an EUA for an upgrade to a commercial office building in Surry Hills and recently supported consultants through the application process for three potential projects. 

A pilot engagement with owners of non-investment grade commercial office buildings supported four owners to implement energy and water efficiency recommendations from audits delivered during through the building owner retrofit process. Based on learnings from the pilot, further strategies have been developed for further piloting;
• An energy monitoring trial to reduce energy wastage and improve building performance. Five buildings have been recruited to participate
• A building tune up trial to achieve energy efficiency through optimising existing plant and equipment in buildings. Two buildings have been recruited to participate. This trial will be run in partnership with the Office of Environment and Heritage

The City continues to improve our streets, parks and plazas for pedestrians. Work includes extensive new tree plantings and landscaping, footpath renewal and widening, and new pedestrian crossings. We are also creating shared zones for safe walking and cycling and assisting in the implementation of the NSW Government’s 40km per hour zone in central Sydney. 

In May 2014 the City undertook a major walking survey, to monitor the scale and movement of pedestrian traffic in Sydney City. It revealed that, of the five top city centre spots with the most foot traffic, three of them are at intersections along George Street, making it the stand-out location for walking in the CBD. The survey will be conducted twice a year in May and October, providing valuable data to guide further improvements. 

The City is working closely with Transport for NSW to deliver safer and better walking conditions, and co-hosted the international Walk21 conference in October 2014.  A draft City of Sydney Walking Strategy and Action Plan is in development.

In October the City launched the first step in a comprehensive wayfinding and tactile signage network that will make the city more accessible for people of all abilities.  The $8 million Legible Sydney Wayfinding System will link central Sydney streets using around 2,100 tactile and braille street signs, pedestrian-friendly maps, information pylons, new signs and digital technology.

Benicia	USA		Private Transport		Transportation demand management		2015	"Updating the Stop Sign Warrant application is a simple, no-cost action that can bring attention to emissions related to installing or removing a stop sign in Benicia. 

When an application is submitted, the Traffic, Pedestrian, and  Bicycle Safety Committee already evaluates traffic counts, circulation, efficiency, speed, and safety. It does not currently evaluate any increase or decrease in GHG emissions as a result of stop sign installation or removal.

A typical vehicle always burns some amount of fuel when the engine is on, even when the vehicle is not moving (idling), although modern vehicles use much less fuel when idling than in motion. Since burning fuel releases air pollutants and GHGs, cutting down on idling time can help improve air quality and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Stop signs result in idling, so when examining whether to add or remove a stop sign, it is important to look at the emissions that would result.

*reductions that could be avoided if committee voted 'no' to a new stop sign; estimated reductions are per stop sign installed assuming at least 300 vehicles pass through the intersection (minimum required if a new stop sign is installed)."	CDP			49787	1184

he City has partnered with Recyclebank to trial a unique incentive program for recycling. Selected blue carts have been retrofitted with an ID chip that reads the weight of the recycled materials collected by that household. Points are earned for every pound of recyclables diverted from the waste stream. Points can be redeemed for discounts at local and national businesses.

A recycling drop off facility is available for collection of household chemicals, computer related equipment, TVs, music equipment, VHS and DVD players, games consoles, computer cables, Compact Fluorescent Light bulbs.  Items with sufficient BTU value, such as oil and gasoline, are sent to secondary fuel or fuel blending facilities. Items such as batteries are sent to a recycling facility, where the metal components are removed and recycled. Some items are sent to specially constructed incinerators. If items can't be recycled or incinerated, they are sent to landfills for hazardous waste. Computers received at the facility have their hard drives wiped clean, before being reused or broken apart, with each material recycled or properly disposed of. Useable paints, stains & other cleaners are available for free at the facility's material exchange room.

In 2007, Chicago City Council amended the ordinance governing small scale residential compost operations into 2 categories. You may compost up to 10 cubic yards of lawn and garden waste, or up to 5 cubic yards of food and yard waste in-vessel. Larger amounts may be allowed with a permit. Small-scale compost operations, as defined by the ordinance, are exempt from City permit requirements.  Back yard composting is encouraged for those people who do not have organic waste collection, or for food scraps which are not accepted in the blue cart yard waste collection program. The City hosts Sustainable Backyard Workshops to teach people about back yard composting. Rebates are provided towards purchasing a compost bin. The Chicago Home Composting Program provides advice."

The regulation applies to new buildings, and existing buildings undergoing major retrofitting works, with a gross floor area of 2,000 m2 or more. These standards benefit building owners as they reduce energy consumption while keeping compliance costs low. 
Starting from 1 Dec 2012, building owners of existing buildings also have to fulfil three requirements under the Building Control Act: a) Achieve minimum Green Mark standard for existing buildings when the building cooling system is installed or replaced; b) Carry out three-yearly energy audit on building cooling systems; and c) Submit building information and energy consumption data to BCA annually."

Singapore	Singapore		Private Transport		Improve fuel economy and reduce CO2 from motorized vehicles		2015	"Under the Carbon Emissions-based Vehicle Scheme (CEVS) that was introduced in Jan 2013, all new and imported used cars, as well as taxis, are banded into categories based on their CO2/ km performance data. Low-emission cars are given incentives, while cars on the other end of the spectrum incur a penalty in the form of a registration surcharge. This encourages more consumers and companies to choose lower-emission car and taxi models. The rebate for taxis is set at 50% higher compared to cars as taxis generally clock higher mileage and thus typically emit more CO2 per year than cars.
The current scheme is due to expire on 30 June 2015. To further encourage vehicle buyers to shift to low carbon emission models, rebates and surcharges will be increased for very low and high carbon emission vehicles respectively. Under the revised CEVS, all new cars and imported used cars registered from 1 July 2015 with low carbon emissions of less than or equal to 135g carbon emissions per kilometre will qualify for rebates of between $5,000 and $30,000, which will be offset against the vehicle’s Additional Registration Fee (ARF).

In addition, BCA has in place various incentive schemes that helps accelerate the rate of buildings achieving better energy efficiency standards. 

The Green Mark Gross Floor Area (GM-GFA) scheme incentivises developers to achieve higher-tier Green Mark ratings in order to receive additional floor area; and the Green Mark Incentive Scheme for Design Prototype (GMIS-DP) incentivises projects that strive for greater energy efficiency by placing more emphasis at the design stage. 

The Green Mark Incentive Scheme for Existing Buildings (GMIS-EB) encourages building owners of existing private commercial developments to implement energy efficient solutions and to conduct energy audit in their existing buildings while the Green Mark Incentive Scheme for Existing Buildings and Premises (GMIS-EBP) incentivises small and medium enterprise building owners and tenants to undertake Energy Improvement Works in existing private commercial buildings and tenanted premises.  

Recognising the difficulties building owners face when applying for banks loans, BCA launched the Building Retrofit Energy Efficiency Financing (BREEF) Scheme which provides credit facilities for eligible parties to carry out energy efficiency retrofits under an Energy Performance Contract arrangement."

Se inaguró el 26 de septiembre de 2013 la iluminación de los 7.2 kilómetros lineales que conforman la Pista de Caminata del Parque Metropolitano, en la que se invirtieron 5 millones 256 mil pesos y 2 millones más en páneles solares, con lo que se beneficiarán directamente 1 millón 500 mil visitantes y deportistas cada año.

Gracias al trabajo conjunto entre la Dirección General de Obras Públicas y la Dirección del Parque Metropolitano, fueron instaladas 282 luminarias a lo largo de la pista, lo cual permitirá que los visitantes se activen físicamente con mayor seguridad y en el horario vespertino y nocturno.

Las lámparas instaladas utilizan luminarios LEDs que disminuyen considerablemente el consumo de energía con las cuales se genera mayor eficiencia de la energía eléctrica, reduce el consumo, el costo económico por pago, así como contribuye a la reducción de emisiones de efecto invernadero precursores del cambio climático.

Así mismo, contribuyendo con la introducción de energías renovables como fuentes generadores de electricidad, se instaló un sistema de energía fotovoltaica conformado por 120 piezas de 195 watts cada una, con lo cual se logra una potencia instalada de 23, 400 Watts. 

Estas obras se suman a la nueva zona infantil, la mejora de áreas verdes, el nuevo sistema de riego y la barda Amazonas que recientemente se realizaron en el parque. Con estas acciones que significan inversión en infraestructura de calidad y con un fin social, se pretende mantener el reconocimiento que poseé el Metropolitano por albergar grandes eventos de talla nacional e internacional.

Gracias a esta infraestructura, el Patronato del Parque Metropolitano pudo  extender el horario de servicio por la tarde, cerrando sus puertas dos horas mas tarde y con ello incrementar el número de visitantes de 1 millón 400 mil personas anuales a 2 millones."	CDP			50359	1978

This innovation was chosen by Bloomberg Philanthropies as one of 5 winners (out of 305 submissions) of the Mayors Challenge, a competition to incentivize innovation in city government and improve citizens' lives.

This cost-neutral, technological innovation is a paradigm shift, changing how people think about waste and recycling. The concept of “trash” will be extinct and replaced by an understanding that all discarded material has value and can be recycled.

Houston will apply proven technologies and new processes, redefining municipal solid waste from a liability to a valuable asset. This first-of-its-kind innovation uses technology in a way that has never been done before. This approach has the potential for cities across the globe to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, save money and create high value materials.

Houston’s innovation will:
• Provide every residence with curbside One Bin for All services;
• Decrease the volume of waste sent to landfills;
• Reduce air pollution; and,
• Manage waste and recycling costs.

Houston will divert up to 75% of its waste. Houston has evidence the technology can work, significantly increasing its recycling rate at a price that is affordable.

The mayor’s Complete Streets and Transportation Plan is meant to provide safe, accessible and convenient use by motorists, public transit riders, pedestrians, people of all abilities and bicyclists.  The new policy, detailed in a draft executive order from the mayor, will be achieved over time as improvements to existing roadways and redevelopment occur.
 
“This executive order is a major first step forward,” said Mayor Parker.  “Many groups have worked hard to get us to this point, including The Complete Streets Coalition, Scenic Houston, AARP and BikeHouston.  I am thankful for their input and steadfast commitment.  Houston is a city that embraces its diversity.  This Complete Streets policy applies the same approach to our mobility system by meeting the diverse needs of all Houstonians while also creating more accessible and attractive connections to residential areas, parks, businesses, restaurants, schools and employment centers.
 
The Complete Streets and Transportation Plan recognizes that all streets are different.  The function of the road, current and projected adjacent land use and travel demands, availability of right-of-way, community input and the level of vehicular, pedestrian and bicycle traffic must all be considered in decisions regarding enhancements.  The ultimate goal, where appropriate, is walkable and bike-friendly neighborhoods with amenities such as trees and landscaping, public art and street furniture.
 
“As we work to build a healthier community, it is more important than ever to reimagine our approach to streets, sidewalks, pedestrian crossings, public transit, bike trails and lanes,” said Mayor Parker.
 
The Plan will build upon and utilize tools such as the city’s Mobility Planning already underway. It will create new definitions found in the city’s Major Thoroughfare and Freeway Plan Policy Statement and the Infrastructure Design Manual.

The System Reimagining project represents a fresh look at METRO’s bus network and how it can best meet the goals for transit in our region.  System Reimagining first seeks to define overall goals for the bus system then design a system with individual routes to meet those goals. By considering an integrated network of bus routes with the expanding rail service – including route alignment, frequency of service, potential connections, and improved links to development patterns – the system can be optimized to provide better service.

Through this process, METRO seeks to make the system easier to use, and more useful to more people.  The benefits should become evident – to existing and potential riders – leading to more trips by more people on public transit service.  A chance for public comment and feedback on the proposed plan is planned for May 2014.

The ordinance is effective immediately.

Vulnerable road users are defined as a walkers or runners; the physically disabled, such as someone in a wheelchair; a stranded motorist or passengers; highway construction, utility or maintenance workers; tow truck operators; cyclists; moped, motor-driven cycle and scooter drivers; or horseback riders.

“As a city, we need to protect everyone and anyone who uses our roads,” said Mayor Annise Parker. “This ordinance will make our city even more attractive to those who want to enjoy traveling in forms other than by car.”

In addition to requiring safe passing and trailing distances from vulnerable road users, this ordinance prohibits any motor vehicle occupant from throwing or projecting any object or substance at or against them.

Similar ordinances have already been enacted by Austin, Fort Worth and San Antonio.  

The Safe Passing ordinance is another initiative, led and/or supported by Mayor Parker, to encourage more cycling in Houston. Others include the launch of Houston Bike Share, closing gaps in Houston’s bike trail system; the voter-approved Bayou Greenways initiative; and approval of HB200, which will allow Houston’s utility easements to be used for hike and bike trails."

Houston	USA		Finance		Instruments to fund low carbon projects		2014	"The City of Houston's 5-Star program got underway in 2010 with economic stimulus funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.  Under the management of HARC (the Houston Advanced Research Center) 59 new, single-family houses were completed through the initiative’s end in September 2013.

“5-Star is unique in the way it incentivizes builders to upgrade new housing to reach ultra-efficiency levels well above Energy Star,” a key federal program that promotes energy-efficient products and practices, said David Hitchcock, the member of HARC’s research staff who has directed the management of the 5-Star program.

“Larger incentives have been provided to motivate builders to reach higher efficiency levels, with those homes receiving the 5-Star rating receiving the largest incentive,” Hitchcock said. “Most of the energy savings in achieving these ultra-high efficiency levels have been obtained through installation of solar panels.”

This program represents an expansion and enhancement of a local house-building program that already existed. In a 2010 progress report, city officials described this existing program, a component of the Houston HOPE program, as an “effort to revitalize blighted but historic neighborhoods by creating new affordable homes in areas with high concentrations of abandoned lots.”

Partnering with a local government authority, the city acquired tax-delinquent properties for redevelopment through Houston HOPE. Six private homebuilders and one non-profit organization in turn acquired sites for new, affordable, single-family homes, which have been upgraded for much greater energy efficiency under the 5-Star program.

Besides solar installations, other areas where builders attained greater efficiency have included water heating, attic insulation, duct placement and selection of appliances.

Receiving a rating of five stars (20-0 on the HERS index) has earned a builder incentive of $50,000. The smallest incentive (for a one-star HERS rating of 45-36) was $25,000.

For the houses built to date, the total annual energy savings that are possible for residents is estimated at about $2,100 each compared with a conventional house. For all those houses combined, the annual reduction in emissions of climate-changing carbon dioxide from power plants is estimated at about 368 tons."	CDP			31108	2331

In January 2014, Houston City Council approved another five percent increase in the Houston Residential Energy Conservation Code.  With this increase the local minimum energy efficiency requirements for new construction of one and two family homes, townhouses and apartments up to three stories in height is 15 percent above what is mandated by state law.  This is the third year in a row the local code has been increased by five percent.

Currently, state law designates the 2009 International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) as the energy code in Texas.  In 2011, Houston City Council adopted a stricter version of the IECC.  An update of the IECC yet to be approved by the state is expected to mirror Houston’s requirements."	CDP			31108	960

The Miami Green Lab is a community green resource center and green job incubator, providing a variety of training, education and certification programs.  Miami Green Lab also aims to promote the awareness of energy-efficiency, climate change and sustainability efforts at a community level including for schools and interested residents, and to increase the awareness of sustainable products, technologies and services through demonstration.  The Green Lab will be a unique and extremely beneficial resource for the local economy and job market.  The completed facility is a former City of Miami fire station renovated to LEED Gold standards and features energy-efficient lighting and HVAC systems, solar hot-water heating, rainwater harvesting, recycled building materials, bicycle racks and xeriscaping amongst other green features.  The building also features a 1,200 square foot training/meeting space.

Lastly through its Office of Sustainable Initiatives, the City hosts a quarterly meeting of the Miami Green Commission whose members include residents, non-profit organization and private sector entities.  Miami Green Commission meetings provide updates and information on the City's efforts to promote sustainability and to address climate change related issues."	CDP			35870	1866

Pittsburgh	USA		Waste		Recycling or composting collections and/or facilities		2014	"Recycling - In November 2008, COP began allowing residents to implement single stream recycling, which means that all recyclable materials could be placed in one curbside container instead of sorting. Studies have shown that single stream increases recycling rates by reducing barriers to participation, thereby increasing solid waste diversion rates from landfills. Though not reflected in the 2008 inventory, Pittsburgh’s 2009 residential recycling rates increased by 12.5 percent after single stream recycling was adopted.  Due to its late 2008 implementation date, Pittsburgh’s curbside single stream recycling policy cannot be credited with the reduction in Pittsburgh municipal employee solid waste over the 5-year benchmark period of this inventory. However, it is a notable policy step for future Pittsburgh GHG inventories.   

Since the program began in 2008 as of 2013 we’ve experience a $3,456,154.00 in earned revenue and a landfill savings of $1,943,805.00 since converting to single stream recycling.

Under this scheme, a finance provider provides funds to a building owner for an environmental improvement project, with the funding repaid over time via Council charges on the land.
Environmental upgrade finance also allows the cost of an upgrade to be shared with the tenant. Under the agreement, a building owner may pass on part of the cost of the upgrade to the tenant providing the amount does not exceed the financial saving that the tenant will benefit from as a result of the upgrade. This means that tenants can enjoy the benefits of an environmental upgrade in the short-term and operating cost savings in the long-term."	CDP			31114	960

Turku will considerably cut the emissions related to heating of buildings by increasing the use of renewable energy in district heat production to at least 50 % by 2020. Less than 10 % of community waste will end up in landfills in 2016, and the production and use of biogas in transport will be promoted. Also actions to support use of electrical vehicles will be developed.

The growth of the emissions related to electricity will be stopped by improving energy efficiency in city functions (20 % improvement from the 2005 level by 2020) and by promoting the energy efficiency of end users. In addition, 100 % of the electricity purchased by the city administration itself (about 100 Gwh/a) has been produced using renewables from 2013 onwards.

The emissions related to the increasing traffic will be controlled by increasing the use of sustainable modes of transport and mobility in relation to other forms of transport.

    Tokyo Cap-and-trade program is the world's first urban cap-and-trade program targeting urban facilities including office buildings and commercial facilities. This is a mandatory emission reduction and emissions trading program launched in April 2010, and it covers approximately 1400 large facilities that consume energy of 1,500kL crude oil equivalent or more per year. It has an absolute cap of 6% for the first compliance period (FY2010-FY2014) and will have a 17% cap for the second compliance period (FY2015-FY2019). During the first compliance period, reduction obligation rate is 8% for the commercial sector including office buildings and 6% for the industrial sector including factories. The facilities can reduce emissions by themselves or acquire credits by trading to accomplish their obligations. Facility owners are required to submit their reduction plan and emissions report verified by the third-party verification agencies every year. This program has achieved 13% reduction in emissions in FY2010 and 23% reduction in FY2011.

• Increase in use of alternative transportation for commuting along the hike and bike trails;
• Increase in property values along the corridor resulting in increased revenue to the city;
• Increased flood prevention due to the opportunity for wet-bottom detention areas in the newly created green spaces;
• Increased water quality due to the simple plantings located strategically along the bayous, the wet-bottom detention ponds, and reduced runoff;

This innovation was chosen by Bloomberg Philanthropies as one of 5 winners (out of 305 submissions) of the Mayors Challenge, a competition to incentivize innovation in city government and improve citizens' lives.

This cost-neutral, technological innovation is a paradigm shift, changing how people think about waste and recycling. The concept of “trash” will be extinct and replaced by an understanding that all discarded material has value and can be recycled.

Houston will apply proven technologies and new processes, redefining municipal solid waste from a liability to a valuable asset. This first-of-its-kind innovation uses technology in a way that has never been done before. This approach has the potential for cities across the globe to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, save money and create high value materials.

Houston’s innovation will:
• Provide every residence with curbside One Bin for All services;
• Decrease the volume of waste sent to landfills;
• Reduce air pollution; and,
• Manage waste and recycling costs.

Houston will divert up to 75% of its waste. Houston has evidence the technology can work, significantly increasing its recycling rate at a price that is affordable.

In March of 2010, the Portland City Council voted to temporarily suspend the B10 minimum biodiesel content requirements of Portland City Code 16.60 due to economic and technical circumstances. The City continues to monitor the situation. The requirement for B5 content remains in place, however at this time, the suspension of the second phase of the local RFS will continue into the foreseeable future. 

The City continues to work on implementing the electric vehicle (EV), strategy (Electric Vehicles: The Portland Way). Major accomplishments include the launch of the City’s EV website (www.chargeportland.com), including an online permitting process. A partnership between Portland State University, Portland General Electric and the City resulted in the opening of Electric Avenue, an urban showcase for EV charging technology. The Avenue features seven different charging stations provided by Eaton, Shorepower Technologies, OpConnect, SPX, ECOtality and General Electric. 
Both the City and the County are supporting the installation of EV charging stations across the region. For example, the County will install 12 EV charging stations at four County sites for use by the public and County personnel. County Chair Jeff Cogen has been appointed by two consecutive Governors to lead statewide working groups on increasing Oregon’s adoption of electric vehicles and fostering local and statewide job growth through transportation electrification.

is funding Oregon’s Public Health Institute to work on this project, including efforts to support public meetings to gather community input. Changes to the code will be brought to the Planning and Sustainability Commission in early 2012. 

BPS continues to assist groups in setting up neighborhood gardens, revising the zoning code and offering Urban Growth Bounty classes to promote homegrown food. Since the adoption of the Climate Action
Plan, PP&R has built 400 new community garden plots. 180 plots were created in existing gardens, and the rest are at new sites constructed since 2009. Other organizations and partners have built an additional
284 plots since 2009. Commissioner Fish is tracking this progress on his website. The sustainable food program in BPS offers marketing and technical support to area farmers markets and Community Supported Agriculture (CSAs) farms and web-based tools to promote direct-market producers. 

The County’s Office of Sustainability is working with regional partners to develop the Institutional Purchasing Alliance, which focuses on leveraging the purchasing power of large organizations to support
local food production through strategic sourcing. The County is using surplus land at two sites to support local food production, reducing community hunger through donations to the Oregon Food Bank and offering additional self directed community garden plots.

San Francisco	USA		Transport		Improve fuel economy and reduce CO2 from motorized vehicles		2012	"The Clean Taxi ordinance was passed in 2008 and originally published as Police Code Section 1135.3. The SFMTA re-enacted the requirement as Transportation Code, Division II, Sections 1106(m) (emissions reductions) and 1114(e)(9)(A) (annual reporting requirement).

As the ordinance went into effect, the SFMTA, in coordination with the Department of the Environment, encouraged companies and drivers to purchase alternative fuel vehicles by providing a Clean Air Taxi Grant incentive. Grants of $2,000 provided by the Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) and the San Francisco Transportation County Authority (SFCTA) were issued to purchasers on a first come-first served basis. A total of $518,670.29 of grant funds was dispersed to help purchase 251 hybrid vehicles.

The policy has been incredibly successful both from industry’s side and from an environmental perspective. Because the law did not mandate the purchase of any specific vehicle, but rather set a performance standard for each cab company’s fleet, and also offered some funds to help transition the first round of new vehicles (in the form of the Clean Air Taxi Grant), drivers and companies were able to choose the vehicles that best match their needs and met the emissions requirements overall. As of January 2012,  the average taxi cab emits 30 metric tons of carbon per year compared to an average emission of 59 metric tons per year in 1990, a 49 percent reduction. The fleet is 92 percent hybrid or CNG vehicles. There are 1,318 alternative fuel vehicles out of a total of 1,432 eligible vehicles. The CNG vehicles account for 89 of those and the hybrids account for 1,229. San Francisco currently has 1,521 taxis in service. Of these, 89 are ramp taxi vehicles that are not subject to clean air vehicle requirements due to the lack of good alternative fuel wheelchair accessible vans available on the market."

Basel-Stadt	Switzerland				Waste to energy		2012	"The waste incinerator of Basel is integrated into the district heating of Basel City. That means that the waste incinerator function as a thermal power plan. The annual waste of 200'000 tonnes is burnt in this infrastructure and creates the equivalent power of about 50,000 tonnes of oil. The incinerator is equipped with the most effective smoke exhaust filter systems, so there is no problem with air pollution.
The wood-power station is integrated into the district heating. It functions as well as a thermal power plant. Thereby about 11‘000 tonnes of oil can be substituted with renewable energy and reduces the CO2-emissions about 36‘000 tonnes."	CDP			31151	651

The “E-Mobil” Cluster currently has 19 members, combining potential of 3 sectors: science and research, private business and public administration. The coordinator is the Warsaw University of Technology, while Warsaw remains the only municipality belonging to the Cluster. By joining different potentials of the City of Warsaw, academic institutions, car companies and energy companies, what allows for synergy effect, we hope to maximize the end results of our actions. 
In the long run, in accordance with worldwide trends, we plan to support envisaged wide implementation of hybrid, and in the next phase purely electric vehicles – in the meantime the measure which is more realistic from financial standpoint to be quickly adopted on wider scale are buses powered by CNG (compressed natural gas)."

Basel-Stadt	Switzerland		Energy Demand in Buildings		Financing mechanisms for retrofit		2012	"For over 20 years, the canton of Basel-Stadt has had a special source of financial revenue in the form of the incentive levy. Since 1984, an additional charge of abaout 5 % has been made on all electricity bills in the canton. This tax generates about 10 million francs (approx. 7 million euros) each year. This money is put towards renovating buildings and promoting renewable energy sources for buildings which are located in the Canton Basel-Stadt. 
Basel-City began a three-year building renovation programme in 2008. Because it was so successful, the programme was incorporated in the existing energy law at the beginning of 2010, and is now offered as standard by the canton. If you decide to renovate, you benefit from a complete project and building monitoring service provided by an independent expert free of charge (that means paid by the canton). The expert will see you (and your potential architect) through the entire renovation, aid with the application for financial support from the government, help clarify technical issues, advise you and ensure that the renovation is carried out in time and in accordance with the relevant laws.  
The Canton Basel-Stadt also invests a part of the funds in pilot and demonstration objects. The “P+D Buildings” programme promotes pilot and showcase buildings in the 2000-Watt-Society. But more information about the 2000-Watt-Society later on.
The Canton Basel-Stadt also invest part of the funds in pilot and demonstration objects and projects for renewable energy sources such as the geothermic project “Deep Heat Mining” which indeed has created some heat within Basel-City: Their drillings have caused an earth tremor in 2006 and since the project had to be stopped."

BPS continues to work with haulers, property managers and tenants to increase recycling levels in multifamily dwellings.

ReUse PDX is a coalition of Portland area non-profit organizations that promotes creative reuse. The City’s Be Resourceful campaign partnered with ReUse PDX at the Better Living Show in March 2011 at the Expo Center. The County also partners with the Reuse PDX group, including Reuse Week each summer to raise awareness of community reuse organizations. 

BPS participated in related diverse community events, including partnering with Multnomah County’s Aging and Disability Services to offer a series of presentations in low income community gatherings.
These efforts resulted in conversations with more than 5,000 residents about fixing and maintaining, sharing, repairing and purchasing durables. 

Over 300 community members also shared their stories at these events so they could be shared online and encourage others to participate (www.portlandonline.com/bps/beresourceful).

Miami 21 instituted a number of programs for sustainability that were adopted into the Code of the City of Miami.  Under Miami 21, the City Code requires all new buildings of more than 50,000 square feet of habitable Rooms and habitable Space in certain zones to be at a minimum certified as Silver by the USGBC LEED standards or equivalent standards adopted or approved by the City. Incentives exist for Gold and Platinum certification and also for properties below 50,000 square feet achieving LEED or equivalent certification.  The initiatives require a fee payment schedule based on square footage of building: 50,000 - 100,000 sf = 2% of construction cost; 100,000 - 200,000 sf = 3% of construction cost; and > 200,000 sf = 4% of construction cost.

Given these changes and, in some cases, the uncertainties they have generated, this edition will take a more descriptive approach to system planning.

It is a design guidebook made for the purpose of providing architects and designers with the basic information and data necessary for a barrier- free environment. Its intent is to establish standards and recommendations that will not only influence the development and reconstruction of the BCD but assume national importance as well. The manual is expected to be a stimulus that will lead, in the long run, to the establishment of national building and planning legislation covering access for disabled people.",

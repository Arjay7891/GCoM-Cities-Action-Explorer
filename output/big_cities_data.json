The bike-share system doesn\u2019t charge membership fees, and operates as a social benefit. Users can register for free and take unlimited 30-minute rides. The scheme has subsequently expanded to a total of 17 stations in the Paulista region and is operational between 6 am and 10 pm. However, the system has limited coverage, and is not integrated with the larger city-wide bicycle sharing scheme.",

Excess water volume, which normally would overflow and cause flooding, will now accumulate in the tanks and be pumped out to the nearby bay. The reservoirs, one of which is complete, while the others are under construction, can accommodate a 25-year rainfall event. Revitalizing the Pra\u00e7a da Bandeira reservoir has transformed the area into a large, welcoming public space, including a 450 m2 skating rink, fitness center for seniors, green areas, new lighting, and a 212 meter circuit for walking. The flood-control plan also involves the construction of a diversion tunnel for the Joana River, to relieve the over-burdened Mangue Channel, which receives water from five different rivers. The Joana River course diversion will create a second outflow to the bay, decreasing dependence on the Mangue Channel. The outflow will also be faster because the water will travel a shorter course. Together, these flood-control plans will prevent flooding onto city streets, infrastructure damage, and the spread of waterborne diseases, and, at the same time, improve traffic conditions.",

                "description": "As in many large cities in the developing world, a large portion of the population of Rio de Janeiro lives in informal settlements or slums, called favelas. Municipal services, including infrastructure, education, and health, have not traditionally reached these favelas, as they have not traditionally been zoned as official parts of the City. However, the Morar Carioca Program, also called the Municipal Plan for the Integration of Informal Settlements, aims to provide integrated development and services through the Municipal Secretary of Housing (SMH) to incorporate these areas into the more formal communities that they generally border. Through holistic urban planning, re-zoning, infrastructure upgrading, housing improvements, regularization of land tenure, City services extensions, and concentrated monitoring, this priority of the Rio de Janeiro city government aims to formalize all of the City's favelas by 2020, improving living conditions for up to 320,000 households. The Morar Carioca Program is part of the initiative called Minha Casa, Minha Vida (My House, My Life-Urbanization of Slums) and falls under the Federal Growth Acceleration Program (PAC), which invested R$ 27.2 billion (USD 13.5 billion) in 3,760 projects between 2007 and 2011.",

Building on the success of the city\u2019s first climate action plan and aiming to accelerate action, the city\u2019s council initiated TransformTO in 2015. The action plan recommends cross-sector targets, including 75% of energy to be renewable and 100% of transportation to use zero-carbon energy by 2050; 100% of new buildings to be near-zero emissions by 2030; and 100% of existing buildings retrofitted by 2050. Toronto seeks to not only address climate change mitigation with these goals, but equally to focus on adapting the city, making it resilient against future impacts. When implemented, these accelerated actions are projected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 857,000 metric tons by 2020. TransformTO is Toronto\u2019s new and ambitious climate action strategy. TransformTO will reduce local greenhouse gas emissions, and improve our health, grow our economy, and improve social equity. \nIn July 2017 City Council unanimously approved a set of long-term, low-carbon goals, and strategies to reach them.",

                "description": "In 2014, Toronto launched two innovative loan programs: Home Energy Loan Program (HELP) and High-Rise Retrofit Improvement Support Program (Hi-RIS). Offered with no upfront costs and at a low interest rate, the loans target energy efficiency and water conservation upgrades in single-family houses and rental apartment buildings. Crucially, the cost of improvements is repaid over time via fixed installments linked to the property tax bill, meaning the loan is tied to the land not the owner, in case of sale. The program also has equity considerations, as owners\u2019 eligibility is not dependent on traditional credit ratings but their rate of municipality repayment. So far, $5.4 million in low-interest loans have been committed to 111 energy projects. The programs\u2019 \u201cone-window\u201d service makes the process as easy and streamlined as possible for participants, allowing access to utility incentives, energy advisors, and customer support in addition to financing. Furthermore, HELP and Hi-RIS are self-sustaining financially and do not impact the city\u2019s taxpayers, as about 60% of the operating budget has been raised from third-party sources and the remainder is recovered directly from program participants through an administrative fee.",

Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) decided to purchase 150 buses for delivery in 2006, and by 2008 the TTC hybrid fleet was over 568 buses. Shortly after the lead acid batteries began failing, and upon inspection by Daimler Bus battery specialists, they found that the batteries had reached the end of their life after only 1 to 1 \u00bd years of operation. Additionally, the predicted emissions reductions were higher than actual results: Predicted: (37% GHG, 30-50% PM, 30-50% NO, 5-6 decibel reduction, and 20-30% less fuel use) Actual: only 10% reduced fuel use, 10% GHG emissions reduced. Concerned with liability issues, TTC moved to hold future shipments of hybrid buses in 2008.",

In the Black Creek neighborhood, a community of 25,000 people which was home to one of SNAP\u2019s six pilot projects, positive results have already been observed; 88 % of participants have undertaken at least one retrofit action since the program launched in 2012. One SNAP program underway in Black Creek, Harvest the Rain, has distributed 217 rain barrels to residents in an effort to protect against basement flooding while using the collected water to support vegetable gardens and tree planting. City-wide, SNAP measures are expected to reduce stormwater runoff and pollutants from private lots by 30 %, expand urban forest cover by 8 %, and reduce electricity use by 10 %.",

Tier 1 compliance is required for all new construction in Toronto, while Tier 2 is a higher, voluntary level of performance, and compliant projects may be eligible for a partial refund of development expenses. To promote water use efficiency, Tier 1 requires buildings to retain at least the first five mm from each rainfall event, while Tier 2 requires the retention of at least 25 mm. Tier 1 requirements have been applied to more than 850 new construction projects, including 75 high-rise buildings, since the program launched, and 15% of new buildings are targeted for Tier 2 level compliance. This program has made Toronto a regional leader in energy efficiency measures. Currently, three municipalities outside of the City of Toronto have adopted the performance measures in their jurisdictions, and other municipalities are looking to do the same.",

The Government has reviewed the green performance targets with a view to further promoting green building in Hong Kong. It updated the joint circular in 2015 to enhance the environmental performance framework of new and existing government buildings.  Bureaux/departments have been advised to strengthen energy saving efforts such as appointing green managers/wardens and adopting green housekeeping measures.  All new government buildings should aim to outperform the Code of Practice for Energy Efficiency of Building Services Installation (the \u201cBuilding Energy Code\u201d or \u201cBEC\u201d) by 3% to 10%.The Government has also been leading by example in implementing energy saving programmes within Government departments. The Government has taken the lead to set specific electricity reduction targets for Government buildings since 2003.  We have already achieved an energy saving of over 15% over the past decade.  On top of this, the Government has set the target of 5% saving in the electricity consumption of government buildings from 2015/16 to 2019/20 under comparable operating conditions in 2013/14.  To achieve this target, a series of measures have been introduced, including the conduct of energy audits for about 350 major government buildings with comparatively high annual electricity consumption to identify energy management opportunities.  At least HK$500 million has been earmarked to gradually implement electricity saving projects identified in the energy audits in the next five years starting in Financial Year 2017/18. A steering committee was set up in January 2013 to strengthen the co-ordination among government departments in promoting green building.",

To mitigate these risks, the city is implementing low-impact and effective landslide protection solutions. Using remote sensing tools and GIS-based landslide modeling, the city has designed and strategically placed both flexible and rigid barriers to resist the impacts of landslides. This approach was chosen in favor of slope stabilization, which is not only costly but also requires extensive earthworks and tree felling.

In 1998, four sets of energy efficiency codes of practice for design of building services, called \u2018Building Energy Codes (BEC)\u2019 were prepared and implemented on a voluntary basis. These codes covered lighting, air conditioning, power, and lift & escalator installations. The Electrical & Mechanical Services Department (EMSD) of the city launched the Hong Kong Energy Efficiency Registration Scheme for Buildings (HKEERSB) to promote the adoption of these codes. Buildings adopting the BECs were issued a certificate, however, this was discretionary . In 2008, the Chief Executive of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region announced their intention to support a low carbon economy. The Buildings Energy Efficiency Ordinance (BEEO) was subsequently legislated as a major government measure for achieving this goal.

Currently being rolled out in each of the city\u2019s 18 districts, Community Green Stations serve as facilities for collecting recyclables and sparking behavioral change by teaching residents about waste separation and segregation. Institutionalizing recycling practices today not only reduces emissions from waste generation, but will also help save residents money in the future, as Hong Kong plans to introduce a pay-as-you-throw waste system in the coming years.",

With a total capacity of 2,000 tons of sludge per day, it will meet the needs of the city beyond 2030. Previously, the wet and energy-rich sludge was dumped in landfills. With incineration at T.PARK, the residual ash uses 90% less landfill volume, and CO2 emissions from landfilling are significantly reduced. The process also generates renewable energy to power the plant and export to the city\u2019s grid. The entire facility has been built as a model for sustainability. Drinking water is provided by a desalination plant and rainwater is collected for non-potable uses. All wastewater generated within the facility is treated on site for reuse, resulting in zero effluent discharge to the sea.",

The project focuses not only on improving and expanding water resources but curbing demand as well. To reduce demand, the city is reducing water loss by repairing and upgrading water mains, lowering leakage rates. The city also encourages water conservation methods through collaboration, active participation, and mutual commitments between public, private, and civic sectors. In terms of supply, Hong Kong is expanding its already world-leading sourcing strategies. While the city has used seawater for toilet flushing for many years, as part of the Total Water Management Strategy, this technique is now applied to 85% of the population as of 2015, saving 27 million m3 of freshwater and accounting for 27% of Hong Kong\u2019s target for the 2020s. Hong Kong is exploring further alternative resources for the remainder of the target including reclaimed water, recycled grey water, and desalinated water.",

The Happy Valley Underground Stormwater Storage Scheme, composed of storage tanks beneath several sports fields with a capacity of 60,000 m3, is currently under construction. The first phase of the scheme was completed in early 2015 with half of its design capacity (30,000 m3) commissioned. The above measures are complemented by sustainability and ecology considerations. Since last decade, Hong Kong has included greening and ecological enhancement in many of the river improvement works. The once channelized streams, such as Ho Chung River, Upper Lam Tsuen River and Kai Tak River, are gradually being revitalised into green rivers. More revitalisation projects such as Tsui Ping River and Yuen Long Nullah are under planning.",

In doing so, the city wants to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve the quality of life for patients and workers in the buildings. Bogot\u00e1 is calculating the carbon footprint of its affiliated hospitals in order to establish a benchmark level for carbon reduction as well as mitigation strategies. Though the program is quite new, a number of pilot projects have already come online, such as a wind power installation at Santa Clara Hospital and solar water heater system at Suba Hospital. As a result of the new measures, there has been a 3.1% decrease in energy use in the pilot hospitals despite a 26.1% increase in services provided between 2012 and 2015.",

The process is undertaken at the landfill\u2019s plant, which boasts one of the largest biogas systems in the country. The plant has a capacity of 30 MW of electricity, operating 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The project reduces CO\u2082 emissions by 900,000 tons per year, and, by 2018, the city plans to construct two additional plants, further increasing the production of biogas and decreasing CO\u2082 emissions.",

It is the city\u2019s roadmap towards climate neutrality, in which 95 specific strategies from six different sectors are defined. The BEK is based on results of an interdisciplinary research project, as well as a broad public participation process, involving stakeholders from industry, civil society, and political organizations. The project combines actions from six different sectors: energy supply, buildings and urban development, economy, traffic, private households and consumption, and adaptation to the consequences of climate change. The specific strategies will ratchet up Berlin\u2019s emissions cuts, from 40% by 2020, 60% by 2030, and at least 85% by 2050 compared with 1990 levels. If monitoring and evaluation finds emissions trends not to be in line with these targets, adjustments are required by law.",

                "description": "Since 2002, Deutsche Bahn (DB), the German railway started a bike rent system named Call-a-Bike. Users could use their cellphones to request a bike, which would be parked in designated areas in the city. The bikes could be unlocked using a pass code received via cell phone and returned to designated spots in the city. This service is available in several German cities including Berlin. In 2011, the city retrofitted the radio-based Call-a-Bike system into a station-based, city-wide bike-share system.",

                "description": "In 2015 the E-Bus Berlin project was created to become the first capital city to turn a complete bus line into an eco-friendly route using battery electric buses, as part of the International Showcase Program for E-mobility Berlin Brandenburg . The Berlin Transport Authority, Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe (BVG), introduced 4 inductive charging electric buses (manufactured by Solaris) on Line 204, converting the line to 100% electric. The project was funded by the Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure with 4.1 million euros . The charging infrastructure was provided by Bombardier Transportation, and the electric drive technology by D\u00fcsseldorf manufacturer Vossloh Kiepe . The bus is recharged at any stop for every 4-7 minutes, so the battery can be significantly smaller and lighter . The bus can skip 1-2 charging places so operation can be maintained (no delay). At night, the buses are charged at the depot via conventional plug-in charging methods. The project aims to increase scale with viable business models by 2020. Berlin and Hamburg plan to purchase up to 200 emissions free vehicles annually , however no manufacturers in Germany have the production capacity to fulfill the orders yet.",

The LRT, an inner-city tram, can carry up to 60,000 people per hour, and after 10 months of operation, ridership has reached 15,000 passengers per hour in each direction. The train is powered by Ethiopia\u2019s power grid, which is fueled almost exclusively by hydropower, geothermal, and wind power. Emissions reductions from the project are estimated to grow from 55,000 tons of CO\u2082 per year in 2015 to 170,000 tons CO\u2082 per year by 2030. The more efficient mode of transportation is expected to stimulate the local economy and attract new investments and will become a blueprint for local expansion and regional replication.",

The pilot program, implemented from 2008-2010, resulted in overall energy cost savings of $1.3 million per year over 7 years against a total investment of $9 million. 146,000m2 of building space was retrofitted, resulting in a reduction of 7,000 tons of carbon emissions and a 28% reduction in energy consumption. Under the RE-FIT program, a public-sector building manager identifies a portfolio of buildings for retrofit and sets a target percentage of savings and a payback period. Then, prequalified ESCOs within the framework bid on the project. The winning bidder carries out and guarantees the retrofit., transferring the delivery risk to the ESCO. It\u2019s estimated that the RE-FIT program allows public sector owners to undertake large-scale retrofits six times faster than if they had carried out their own projects. Over 35 public sector organizations in London have signed an MOU committing them to use RE-FIT. Some example projects include the University of London, Kew Gardens, and the London Fire Brigade.",

It is located in the most populated and driest part of the United Kingdom \u2013 an area classified by the UK Environment Agency as being \u2018severely\u2019 water stressed. One of the city\u2019s main concerns is maintaining a secure and sustainable supply of fresh water, especially as Thames Water, the main water utility for London, estimates that without action, demand for water will exceed supply by 213 million litres of water per day by 2025. This deficit reflects a combination of the expected increasing demand for water from a growing population, the projected decreasing availability of rainfall in warmer, drier summers due to climate change, and need to integrate the European legislative requirement to protect unsustainable water abstractions. The city government is working closely with Thames Water on a twin-track programme to balance supply and demand for water through improving the water efficiency of existing properties while seeking new climate-resilient water resources.",

Seeing public green spaces reduced almost 78% in the past 40 years in the city, while also experiencing steady population growth and regular flooding events, Jakarta needed a solution. To reach the 30% target, Jakarta has begun building parks through the Green Open Space and Child-Friendly Integrated Public Spaces program. By 2016, the city had completed 200 parks, and is set to complete 306 by the end of 2017. Increasing green infrastructure has improved the city\u2019s resilience and reduced flood duration from the former three days to just three hours per flooding event.",

The restriction on groundwater extraction, decreed by regional regulation, is a key measure for slowing down land subsidence. The Northern Jakarta area is mandated to have 100% water-supply coverage and 0% groundwater abstraction by 2015. The rest of the city will also see groundwater extraction phased out in geographic bands moving southward by 2020, 2025 and 2030, with the similar assumption that piped water will be provided in all districts by 2030. This initiative is co-financed by taxing groundwater consumption and is supported by development of alternate water supply piping for large industrial users or relocation of large groundwater users outside the \u2018critical zones\u2019, but it admittedly still faces some challenges of proper enforcement. Other initiatives include construction of East Flood Canal and interconnection canals; Jakarta Emergency Dredging Initiative\u00a0of vital waterways (currently at 30% capacity partly due to clogging by high volume of improperly disposed solid waste); reconstruction of pumps; protection of natural coastal defences (mangroves); construction of sea embankments; and resettlement of illegal housing along rivers and lakes.",

This is a mandatory emission reduction and emissions trading program launched in April 2010, and it covers approximately 1400 large facilities that consume energy of 1,500kL crude oil equivalent or more per year. It has an absolute cap of 6% for the first compliance period (FY2010-FY2014) and will have a 17% cap for the second compliance period (FY2015-FY2019). During the first compliance period, reduction obligation rate is 8% for the commercial sector including office buildings and 6% for the industrial sector including factories. The facilities can reduce emissions by themselves or acquire credits by trading to accomplish their obligations. Facility owners are required to submit their reduction plan and emissions report verified by the third-party verification agencies every year. This program has achieved 13% reduction in emissions in FY2010 and 23% reduction in FY2011. \nAs an innovative GHG reduction program in city level, Tokyo Cap-and-trade program received \"The Most Ground-breaking Policy Award\" from the World Green Building Council in December 2011 and was nominated to a finalist of FT/Citi Ingenuity Award 2012 by the Financial Times and the Citibank Group.\nhttp://www.kankyo.metro.tokyo.jp/en/climate/cap_and_trade.html",

While Tokyo already works with owners to reduce energy use, tenant engagement is essential to accelerate the uptake of energy efficiency upgrades. The program not only increases awareness and transparency, but also incentivizes owners and tenants to collaborate by making tenants responsible parties. In addition, the city supports the disclosure program by providing important information on how to improve energy performance, as well as pilot projects for retrofits and environmental performance attached to leases",

                "description": "For several years, redevelopment of the area faced numerous obstacles. The East Futako-Tamagawa District Urban Redevelopment Committee was formed to undertake redevelopment efforts through community consensus. Tokyu Corporation remodeled the Futako Tamagawa station in 1997 and the project plan for development of the area on eastside of the station was finalized in 2000 . One of the largest urban redevelopment projects in Tokyo, the key mechanism adopted for redevelopment of Den-en-toshi Line and Futako-Tamagawa Station refers to internalization of accessibility and aggregation effect, market-driven redevelopment strategy, and inclusive long-term redevelopment plan with integration of transportation, commercial center and a high-quality living environment . With Phase-I (including two shopping centers, one 16-floor office building, five residential buildings and 1,033 apartments) completed in 2011, and Phase-II (comprising of two commercial buildings, a hotel, cinema complex and new public park) in 2015, the redevelopment around Futako Tamagawa Station reflects Tokyu Corporation\u2019s new strategy and key approaches to recent and projected market trends . The development features a new center for commercial, residential, and leisure activities, with urban accessibility around the railway station and suburban amenities by the Tama River. The redevelopment has taken nearly 15 years, involving more than 200 landowners and tenants in inclusive and complex floor area reallocation procedures. Owning more than 95 percent of the property rights around the station, the corporation has made a real effort to integrate multiple objectives and functions into one redevelopment, so as to generate recurrent benefits through synergistic area management activities rather than temporary profits from speculation. The inner-city office spaces included in this mixed-use development target innovative industries and creative workers. The corporation has also differentiated the new shopping facilities for younger consumers from existing retail stores for elderly residents around the station, intending to generate commercial synergies rather than redistributive effects in the same station area. The project has provided a generous amount of new public facilities, such as a transit plaza, local roads, and parks, through an urban redevelopment scheme and has helped reduce load on the environment. It has also enhanced connectivity of districts through rail-integrated development, while creating a city identity with symbolic design.",

                "description": "The City of Tokyo lies largely below the flood level of its three main rivers, has high annual rainfall and is vulnerable to storm surges, earthquakes and tsunamis. Climate change is projected to increase peak river discharge and frequencies (peak discharge currently up to 100 times higher compared to minimum discharge), raise high tide and increase typhoon size, and exacerbate the impacts of potential earthquakes and tsunamis due to higher sea level. Thus, extreme floods are expected to occur more frequently in the future. To respond to the multitude of risks, Tokyo has developed the concept of a super levee. A super levee is a robust broad river embankment resistant to overflow, seepage and even earthquakes, thanks to special seismic reinforcement. It mainly differs from a conventional dyke by its width (a 10 m high super levee will be about 300 m wide). Super levees are well suited for dense urban areas, allowing for urban development on its top, integrating multifunctional structures and, compared to traditional levees, allowing easy access to rivers and reconnection with urban water ecosystems. For instance, the super levee built along Tokyo\u2019s Ara River combines a broad dyke with a park and a small high-rise, whereas the Sumida River super levee combines a broad dyke/flood-wall with a promenade and a large high-rise.",

Since 2015, the program has employed 180 of these consultants who offer energy-saving advice and tips, and carry out home energy retrofits. Many consultants build on this experience and continue their career in energywelfare related fields.",

CO2 vehicle emissions are being reduced by 10% - a total of 2 million tons of CO2, delivering annual savings of $50 million USD in fuel costs. The improved air quality is also improving the health of residents, saving the City millions annually. The program works because it is applied during weekdays, which encourages people to use alternate modes of transport to and from work. A voluntary program where people choose one day a week (Monday to Friday) as a no driving day. Participants are given incentives, which are provided by public organisations and private companies, such as discounted petrol, free parking and car washing, to use alternate modes of transport of the selected days. Participants are encouraged to take part as often as they can. Those participating just three times a year, for example, will have their incentives removed or diminished.",

Consisting of both grey and green interventions, the program will repair drainage pipes under key corridors and repave streets and sidewalks with permeable pavement in order to prevent flooding during extreme weather events. Furthermore, corner extensions at intersections will improve pedestrian safety, and planting trees and green spaces will help the city manage rainwater, mitigate urban heat island effects, and serve as attractive public spaces. The project is financed by the city\u2019s bus rapid transit system, Metrobus, and aligns with the objectives of the larger, city-wide Comprehensive Mobility Program. As such, the project takes care to ensure that these newly renovated and redesigned streets are accessible and well-connected by adding and improving existing bicycle paths and integrating transit lines along these corridors.",

Mexico City already has an ambitious Climate Action Program calling for a 30% reduction in CO2 by 2020, but reducing emissions from existing, inefficient buildings is notoriously difficult. When done right, however, efficiency upgrades can be one of the cheapest ways to reduce emissions, as the pilot project at La Villa Pediatric Hospital demonstrates.

                "description": "Spreading across almost 16,500m2, Parque Lineal La Viga was constructed in the eastern part of Mexico City in 2015, mitigating urban climate vulnerabilities such as floods, water shortages, and heatwaves, in addition to preventing unequal urban development in an underprivileged part of the city. Up to 60% of the park\u2019s area serves as a rain water catchment surface, mitigating floods by relieving pressure from the drainage and sewage systems. The collected stormwater is then treated and can be used as potable water, diversifying the city\u2019s water sources.",

                "description": "In March 2012, Mexico City\u2019s administration initiated a barter market project to trade clean and separated household solid waste recyclables for locally produced agricultural products. The overall objective of the barter market is to build an educational program promoting a culture of recycling and local consumption among the population of Mexico City. With about 12,500 tons of municipal solid waste generated per day ending up in landfills, the city created the barter market to explore sustainable alternatives to landfilling, as well as develop and maintain a culture of waste minimization and recycling. An additional aim of the project is to provide support to local producers and traditional forms of agriculture in the rural areas of Mexico City.",

By installing rainwater harvesting systems and water purification technologies in houses, apartments, and public buildings, 75 million liters of water have been saved since the implementation of the program. One of the main goals is to consolidate the reuse of rainwater in the city, thus avoiding overexploitation of aquifers and groundwater systems, the latter of which is already sinking up to 40 cm per year. Since its implementation, nearly 500 rainwater harvesting systems, water purification technologies, and drinking devices have been installed, benefitting 56,320 people. The program\u2019s focus goes beyond water conservation, and it has become a core part of the city\u2019s social policy, with its efforts towards gender equality. To promote empowerment of women who have suffered domestic violence, the city offers these women training in the installation and maintenance of rainwater harvesting systems.",

The corridor begins at the Iyana Ipaja terminal and traverses through major roundabouts, junctions and bus stops at Alaguntan, Moshalasi, Egbeda, Idimu, bus depot entrance at Ikotun, Igando road and terminates at Igando terminal. The first 10 km is a dual carriageway from Iyana Ipaja to Ikotun while the final 6 km is a single carriageway from Ikotun to Igando. An additional 10.9km tributary route [Maryland-Iyana Ipaja], originally identified in the Lagos BRT feasibility study was incorporated into the BFS infrastructure design. This tributary route connects BRT with the BFS corridor. Till date, over 86 bus pilots, 90 bus officers and 62 bus inspectors have so far been recruited and over 30 million passengers have been carried till date with an average number of 900 per bus daily since its inception in August, 2009",

Ten studies were completed across a range of coastal neighborhoods in the city which analyzed damage from Hurricane Sandy; risks from coastal storms, including 10-, 50-, and 100-year storms; flood elevations; wave threats; future floodplains; and sea level rise. Information from these studies will help shape how and where development occurs on vulnerable coastal land and protect the 71,500 buildings currently located along these shorelines.",

New York City is identifying vulnerable shorelines with comprehensive and detailed analyses, including data on daily high tide inundation, calculated using localized sea level rise projections from the New York City Panel on Climate Change (NPCC) and a wave atlas produced specifically for this project. Using the 90th percentile of projections for the 2050s produced by NPCC, projects were identified that will fortify vulnerable stretches of shoreline to prevent inundation of buildings and infrastructure in a future where the highest average level of the New York Harbor could rise by 81 cm. Analysis of New York City\u2019s more than 965 km of shoreline led to the selection of 15 projects that will make the city\u2019s coastline more resilient to the risks posed by sea level rise.",

New York City's government departments all have previously developed their own development guidance but lacked a consistent approach for how to use climate projections. The guidelines provide a consistent methodology for engineers, architects, and planners to design facilities that are resilient to continued changes in climate across the entire lifespan of the facilities. The Climate Resiliency Design Guidelines are multi-hazard, addressing all major climate change risks identified by the New York City Panel on Climate Change. The guidelines address some of New York\u2019s most acute issues, such as how to limit the urban heat island effect, while also protecting facilities against extreme heat. By recommending flexible adaptation pathways, a way of designing facilities with coastal storm protections that are upgradable, the city will limit urban flooding from extreme precipitation. In doing so, the city is not only becoming increasingly resilient but also a more enjoyable place to live for millions of New Yorkers.",

Phase one of the stormwater infrastructure implementation projects has the potential to capture approximately 72 million liters per year. Additionally, NYCHA will provide back-up power for all Sandyaffected developments, develop microgrids at certain developments, and install 25 MW of solar power in an effort to protect public housing residents from the short- and long-term impacts of climate change.",

A case in point is the Saw Mill Creek marsh, a severely degraded wetland on Staten Island\u2019s west shore, which could have provided the absorptive capacity to mitigate much of the severe flooding that occurred during Hurricane Sandy in 2012. After the Hurricane, NYC lacked a sustainable funding source that it could draw on to restore this and many other degraded wetlands throughout the City. Healthy wetlands are needed to provide a resiliency buffer for coastline communities, many of which are disproportionately lower income than communities across the city at large. To address these issues, NYC introduced MARSHES, a citywide wetland mitigation banking program, which utilises one-time Federal recovery funding to perpetuate a sustainable and replicable program for wetland restoration and resiliency improvements across the city.",

This public sector investment is designed to spur private engagement and lead to a quarter of all vehicles being electric by 2035.",

                "description": "It has been two years since the city of Los Angeles launched a major public works project to retrofit the city\u2019s street lighting with energy-efficient LED (lightemitting diode) fixtures, making this a good opportunity to assess progress. The project is still the largest LED street lighting retrofit ever undertaken globally; its implementation is ahead of schedule and the energy cost savings are surpassing original projections, largely due to continued improvements in the energy efficiency of LED technology. The project is a collaboration between the Los Angeles Bureau of Street Lighting; the Los Angeles Mayor\u2019s Office; the Department of Water & Power; and the Clinton Climate Initiative (CCI) Cities Program, which is now a fully integrated partner with the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40). Targeting 140,000 of the city\u2019s more than 209,000 street lights, the objectives of the retrofit project are to enhance the quality of municipal street lighting, reduce light pollution, improve street safety, and save both energy and money. The city budgeted $57 million for the project, to be carried out over a five-year period. Upon full implementation, the project is expected to return an estimated $10 million in energy and maintenance cost savings to the city while avoiding at least 40,500 tons of CO2 emissions each year.",

The bike-share system doesn\u2019t charge membership fees, and operates as a social benefit. Users can register for free and take unlimited 30-minute rides. The scheme has subsequently expanded to a total of 17 stations in the Paulista region and is operational between 6 am and 10 pm. However, the system has limited coverage, and is not integrated with the larger city-wide bicycle sharing scheme.",

The center is meant to optimize city functioning, especially in the face of large-scale events, and to respond proactively to emergency situations. After torrential rains and flash flooding in 2010 killed nearly 70 city residents (and scores more in the surrounding state), Mayor Eduardo Paes sought a way to better manage emergencies as well as day-to-day operations in the City. Working with IBM, the City of Rio de Janeiro created a center where utilities, police, the central fire department, the health department, and other relevant agencies can monitor everything from weather, traffic, trash collection, electricity, water, and gas to disease outbreaks and emergency situations. A crisis room also allows the mayor and his advisors to make executive decisions in emergency situations, whether natural disasters or security threats. By increasing efficiency of service delivery and improving responses to outages and service failures, the Operations Center helps Rio de Janeiro become a more sustainable and integrated city, in addition to a safer one.",

Such securities will include not only those based on existing asset classes, such as renewable energy or biomass, but also those of a regulatory nature, created for the compliance of environmental obligations, such as forest certificates, waste recovery and recycling certificates, greenhouse gas emission allowances and credits, and allowances of liquid effluents. These environmental securities will be created through multistakeholder processes involving the government, industry, and civil society. For this reason, BVRio was structured as an independent, not-for-profit partnership with membership from across different sectors (e.g., private, nongovernmental organizations and academia, and leaders in environment and sustainable finance). Each sector is represented on the BVRio Board, which is complemented by an Advisory Board that includes representatives of the three spheres of the government (municipal, state, and federal levels).",

Further, Morar Carioca has developed a reforestation plan with the communities for degraded areas abutting the Tijuca National Park, which will allow them to explore eco-tourism and sustainable use micro-industry for alternative revenue generation.",

                "description": "As in many large cities in the developing world, a large portion of the population of Rio de Janeiro lives in informal settlements or slums, called favelas. Municipal services, including infrastructure, education, and health, have not traditionally reached these favelas, as they have not traditionally been zoned as official parts of the City. However, the Morar Carioca Program, also called the Municipal Plan for the Integration of Informal Settlements, aims to provide integrated development and services through the Municipal Secretary of Housing (SMH) to incorporate these areas into the more formal communities that they generally border. Through holistic urban planning, re-zoning, infrastructure upgrading, housing improvements, regularization of land tenure, City services extensions, and concentrated monitoring, this priority of the Rio de Janeiro city government aims to formalize all of the City's favelas by 2020, improving living conditions for up to 320,000 households. The Morar Carioca Program is part of the initiative called Minha Casa, Minha Vida (My House, My Life-Urbanization of Slums) and falls under the Federal Growth Acceleration Program (PAC), which invested R$ 27.2 billion (USD 13.5 billion) in 3,760 projects between 2007 and 2011.",

The PSAM is an important step to achieve key goals of the state: to universalize sanitation in the region and to advance the environmental restoration of the bay. This restoration goal is one of the State's commitments for the 2016 Olympic Games, since the Bay will host several contests during the competition.",

Currently, most vegetable oil is poured into drains, polluting the water system and impairing the pipes of buildings and sewage treatment networks. In regions where there is no collection system, the oil goes directly into rivers and lakes, significantly increasing pollution and environmental degradation.

Through a plan to install a methane capture system throughout the landfill, Novo Gramacho Energia Ambiental and Companhia Municipal de Limpeza Urbana (COMLURB) were able to leverage Clean Development Mechanism financing to reduce the climate change impact of the Gramacho operations and to create a potential income stream for these actors in the future, through sell-back of the energy to a nearby Petrobras facility. Currently, some of the methane captured is flared, which still reduces its total carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions; however, a purification system and a pipeline present an income-generating opportunity for the landfill and private investors that further decreases the climate change impact of the landfill and increases its economic value.",

Given the great opportunity to increase the collection of recycled material in the City, the closing of informal waste sorting networks, and the passage of the National Solid Waste Law, the City has decided to prioritize increasing household waste separation and recycling programs. The City and its Municipal Urban Waste/Cleaning Company (COMLURB) aim to collect an additional 31,000 tons of waste per year by 2015, raising overall recycling rates to 5 percent.

Excess water volume, which normally would overflow and cause flooding, will now accumulate in the tanks and be pumped out to the nearby bay. The reservoirs, one of which is complete, while the others are under construction, can accommodate a 25-year rainfall event. Revitalizing the Pra\u00e7a da Bandeira reservoir has transformed the area into a large, welcoming public space, including a 450 m2 skating rink, fitness center for seniors, green areas, new lighting, and a 212 meter circuit for walking. The flood-control plan also involves the construction of a diversion tunnel for the Joana River, to relieve the over-burdened Mangue Channel, which receives water from five different rivers. The Joana River course diversion will create a second outflow to the bay, decreasing dependence on the Mangue Channel. The outflow will also be faster because the water will travel a shorter course. Together, these flood-control plans will prevent flooding onto city streets, infrastructure damage, and the spread of waterborne diseases, and, at the same time, improve traffic conditions.",

Without a \"declaration of the availability of potable water\" (DPA), a license certifying that new buildings had legal and sufficient access to water, the demand for additional construction in the region could not be met and construction could not be sustainable. To overcome the lack of resources and of operational capacity to take on the challenge in a timely manner in the public sector, the Barra da Tijuca Community Association C\u00e2mara Comunit\u00e1ria da Barra da Tijuca (CCBT) reached out to the State Company of Water and Wastewater (Companhia Estadual de \u00c1guas e Esgotos-CEDAE), and to interested construction and commercial companies in the area, to leverage private financing for new water pipelines in exchange for water for future development project completion. Through this innovative strategy, CCBT helped ensure that CEDAE and local business interests were able to ensure safe, legal, and sustainable water provision for the growing Baixada de Jacarepagu\u00e1 population.",

The Brazilian city\u2019s program is planting 20,000 trees native to the Atlantic Forest biome, and using sludge from the city\u2019s sewage, treated by anaerobic digestion, and biosolids from an industrial wastewater plant as fertilizer.

To date, these proposals for reduced parking have been handled on a case by case basis. A consultant study determined that the availability of car share parking has a small but significant impact on reducing the building's level of car ownerhip, and therefore parking demand. The study found that a reduction of up to 4 parking spaces for each dedicated car share space can be warranted.",

Tier 1 compliance is required for all new construction in Toronto, while Tier 2 is a higher, voluntary level of performance, and compliant projects may be eligible for a partial refund of development expenses. To promote water use efficiency, Tier 1 requires buildings to retain at least the first five mm from each rainfall event, while Tier 2 requires the retention of at least 25 mm. Tier 1 requirements have been applied to more than 850 new construction projects, including 75 high-rise buildings, since the program launched, and 15% of new buildings are targeted for Tier 2 level compliance. This program has made Toronto a regional leader in energy efficiency measures. Currently, three municipalities outside of the City of Toronto have adopted the performance measures in their jurisdictions, and other municipalities are looking to do the same.",

The action plan recommends cross-sector targets, including 75% of energy to be renewable and 100% of transportation to use zero-carbon energy by 2050; 100% of new buildings to be near-zero emissions by 2030; and 100% of existing buildings retrofitted by 2050. Toronto seeks to not only address climate change mitigation with these goals, but equally to focus on adapting the city, making it resilient against future impacts. When implemented, these accelerated actions are projected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 857,000 metric tons by 2020. TransformTO is Toronto\u2019s new and ambitious climate action strategy. TransformTO will reduce local greenhouse gas emissions, and improve our health, grow our economy, and improve social equity. \nIn July 2017 City Council unanimously approved a set of long-term, low-carbon goals, and strategies to reach them.",

Offered with no upfront costs and at a low interest rate, the loans target energy efficiency and water conservation upgrades in single-family houses and rental apartment buildings. Crucially, the cost of improvements is repaid over time via fixed installments linked to the property tax bill, meaning the loan is tied to the land not the owner, in case of sale. The program also has equity considerations, as owners\u2019 eligibility is not dependent on traditional credit ratings but their rate of municipality repayment. So far, $5.4 million in low-interest loans have been committed to 111 energy projects. The programs\u2019 \u201cone-window\u201d service makes the process as easy and streamlined as possible for participants, allowing access to utility incentives, energy advisors, and customer support in addition to financing.

Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) decided to purchase 150 buses for delivery in 2006, and by 2008 the TTC hybrid fleet was over 568 buses. Shortly after the lead acid batteries began failing, and upon inspection by Daimler Bus battery specialists, they found that the batteries had reached the end of their life after only 1 to 1 \u00bd years of operation. Additionally, the predicted emissions reductions were higher than actual results: Predicted: (37% GHG, 30-50% PM, 30-50% NO, 5-6 decibel reduction, and 20-30% less fuel use) Actual: only 10% reduced fuel use, 10% GHG emissions reduced. Concerned with liability issues, TTC moved to hold future shipments of hybrid buses in 2008.",

Assisting residents from planning to implementation of projects, SNAP simultaneously targets energy conservation, urban forest enhancement, water conservation, and stormwater management, as well as local food production in order to create more resilient neighborhoods. In the Black Creek neighborhood, a community of 25,000 people which was home to one of SNAP\u2019s six pilot projects, positive results have already been observed; 88 % of participants have undertaken at least one retrofit action since the program launched in 2012. One SNAP program underway in Black Creek, Harvest the Rain, has distributed 217 rain barrels to residents in an effort to protect against basement flooding while using the collected water to support vegetable gardens and tree planting. City-wide, SNAP measures are expected to reduce stormwater runoff and pollutants from private lots by 30 %, expand urban forest cover by 8 %, and reduce electricity use by 10 %.",

Turning food waste to energy is one of the key backbone strategies adopted in the Plan. On this, the Government had commissioned a pilot composting plant in mid-2008 to gather experience and information and is planning to develop Organic Waste Treatment Facilities (OWTFs) in phases to recycle food waste into compost and biogas as renewable energy. The first phase of Organic Waste Treatment Facilities (OWTF) which will handle 200 tonnes of food waste a day by biological treatment technology is under construction and scheduled to be in operation in 2017. Tendering process for the second phase of OWTF that would treat 300 tonnes of food waste each day was commenced in December 2016.",

The upgrading exercise can bring about an estimated annual saving of some 300 GWh in electricity consumption with a reduction of about 210 000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emission in Hong Kong.   We are working to extending the scope of MEELS to cover five more types of electrical appliances, i.e. televisions, washing machines (with a washing capacity of 7kg - 10kg), room air conditioners (heat pump), electric storage water heaters and induction cookers, and intend to introduce legislation to extend the scope of the Scheme within the 2016-17 legislative year.  The total amount of energy saved from the expanded MEELS is expected to be more than 600 million kWh per annum.",

The Government has reviewed the green performance targets with a view to further promoting green building in Hong Kong. It updated the joint circular in 2015 to enhance the environmental performance framework of new and existing government buildings.  Bureaux/departments have been advised to strengthen energy saving efforts such as appointing green managers/wardens and adopting green housekeeping measures.  All new government buildings should aim to outperform the Code of Practice for Energy Efficiency of Building Services Installation (the \u201cBuilding Energy Code\u201d or \u201cBEC\u201d) by 3% to 10%.The Government has also been leading by example in implementing energy saving programmes within Government departments. The Government has taken the lead to set specific electricity reduction targets for Government buildings since 2003.  We have already achieved an energy saving of over 15% over the past decade.  On top of this, the Government has set the target of 5% saving in the electricity consumption of government buildings from 2015/16 to 2019/20 under comparable operating conditions in 2013/14.  To achieve this target, a series of measures have been introduced, including the conduct of energy audits for about 350 major government buildings with comparatively high annual electricity consumption to identify energy management opportunities.  At least HK$500 million has been earmarked to gradually implement electricity saving projects identified in the energy audits in the next five years starting in Financial Year 2017/18. A steering committee was set up in January 2013 to strengthen the co-ordination among government departments in promoting green building.",

Quantitative risk assessments had predicted up to 2,500 landslides per year and identified high-risk zones. To mitigate these risks, the city is implementing low-impact and effective landslide protection solutions. Using remote sensing tools and GIS-based landslide modeling, the city has designed and strategically placed both flexible and rigid barriers to resist the impacts of landslides. This approach was chosen in favor of slope stabilization, which is not only costly but also requires extensive earthworks and tree felling.

In 1998, four sets of energy efficiency codes of practice for design of building services, called \u2018Building Energy Codes (BEC)\u2019 were prepared and implemented on a voluntary basis. These codes covered lighting, air conditioning, power, and lift & escalator installations. The Electrical & Mechanical Services Department (EMSD) of the city launched the Hong Kong Energy Efficiency Registration Scheme for Buildings (HKEERSB) to promote the adoption of these codes. Buildings adopting the BECs were issued a certificate, however, this was discretionary . In 2008, the Chief Executive of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region announced their intention to support a low carbon economy. The Buildings Energy Efficiency Ordinance (BEEO) was subsequently legislated as a major government measure for achieving this goal. The ordinance covers new construction and major retrofits of existing commercial buildings.",

With incineration at T.PARK, the residual ash uses 90% less landfill volume, and CO2 emissions from landfilling are significantly reduced. The process also generates renewable energy to power the plant and export to the city\u2019s grid. The entire facility has been built as a model for sustainability. Drinking water is provided by a desalination plant and rainwater is collected for non-potable uses.

To reduce demand, the city is reducing water loss by repairing and upgrading water mains, lowering leakage rates. The city also encourages water conservation methods through collaboration, active participation, and mutual commitments between public, private, and civic sectors. In terms of supply, Hong Kong is expanding its already world-leading sourcing strategies. While the city has used seawater for toilet flushing for many years, as part of the Total Water Management Strategy, this technique is now applied to 85% of the population as of 2015, saving 27 million m3 of freshwater and accounting for 27% of Hong Kong\u2019s target for the 2020s. Hong Kong is exploring further alternative resources for the remainder of the target including reclaimed water, recycled grey water, and desalinated water.",

In doing so, the city wants to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve the quality of life for patients and workers in the buildings. Bogot\u00e1 is calculating the carbon footprint of its affiliated hospitals in order to establish a benchmark level for carbon reduction as well as mitigation strategies. Though the program is quite new, a number of pilot projects have already come online, such as a wind power installation at Santa Clara Hospital and solar water heater system at Suba Hospital. As a result of the new measures, there has been a 3.1% decrease in energy use in the pilot hospitals despite a 26.1% increase in services provided between 2012 and 2015.",

The plant has a capacity of 30 MW of electricity, operating 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

The aim was to privilege conscious consumption and a strong recycling policy for the city, while making sure the informal \u201crecyclers\u201d are integrated into the social and economic structure of the city, dignified for their labour and remunerated appropriately. The Zero Waste program, which was integrated in the city\u2019s Development Program \"Bogot\u00e1\u00a0Humana\" in 2012, has 6 priority areas: 1) Separation at source; 2) Manufacturers\u2019 extended responsibility; 3) Recycling model; 4) Reduction of disposal in city landfill; 5) Zero debris; and 6) Hazardous and special waste management.",

Launched in 2014, the project is a means to ensure water security in the city, with 184.4 hectares going through a restoration process and 164.5 hectares going through a reconversion process. Sixteen micro watersheds and more than 12 municipalities were identified as critical focal points. Research is underway on plants that can absorb higher quantities of water, and vegetation cover is increasing. By buffering high mountain ecosystems, more water is able to be absorbed naturally and flow to the reservoir for storag",

This is owed to the reduction of the traffic and technical improvements. The scenarios are linked with the scenarios of the energy consumption development of Berlins Energy Concept 2020.",

The BEK is based on results of an interdisciplinary research project, as well as a broad public participation process, involving stakeholders from industry, civil society, and political organizations. The project combines actions from six different sectors: energy supply, buildings and urban development, economy, traffic, private households and consumption, and adaptation to the consequences of climate change. The specific strategies will ratchet up Berlin\u2019s emissions cuts, from 40% by 2020, 60% by 2030, and at least 85% by 2050 compared with 1990 levels.

The Berlin Transport Authority, Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe (BVG), introduced 4 inductive charging electric buses (manufactured by Solaris) on Line 204, converting the line to 100% electric. The project was funded by the Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure with 4.1 million euros . The charging infrastructure was provided by Bombardier Transportation, and the electric drive technology by D\u00fcsseldorf manufacturer Vossloh Kiepe . The bus is recharged at any stop for every 4-7 minutes, so the battery can be significantly smaller and lighter . The bus can skip 1-2 charging places so operation can be maintained (no delay). At night, the buses are charged at the depot via conventional plug-in charging methods. The project aims to increase scale with viable business models by 2020. Berlin and Hamburg plan to purchase up to 200 emissions free vehicles annually , however no manufacturers in Germany have the production capacity to fulfill the orders yet.",

                "description": "At the start of the implementation period, there was a significant lack of information and a general fear associated with CNG engines. There were also widespread doubts regarding the performance of CNG vehicles compared to conventional cars. The measures therefore comprised both awareness-raising campaigns and financial incentives in order to achieve a critical mass of CNG vehicles in the short term. The aim was to introduce 100 CNG-powered lorries in different weight categories (from 1.3 t to 12 t) for inner-city freight distribution in Berlin, achieving Euro IV/Enhanced environmentally friendly vehicle (EEV) standard.",

The LRT, an inner-city tram, can carry up to 60,000 people per hour, and after 10 months of operation, ridership has reached 15,000 passengers per hour in each direction. The train is powered by Ethiopia\u2019s power grid, which is fueled almost exclusively by hydropower, geothermal, and wind power. Emissions reductions from the project are estimated to grow from 55,000 tons of CO\u2082 per year in 2015 to 170,000 tons CO\u2082 per year by 2030. The more efficient mode of transportation is expected to stimulate the local economy and attract new investments and will become a blueprint for local expansion and regional replication.",

With walking taking up more than 60% of the city\u2019s modal split, the BRT offers a much needed alternative to getting around the city, offering a faster, regular, more equitable and reliable transport option. The 16 km pilot corridor for Addis-Ababa\u2019s BRT is currently in detail design phase. Expansion of the system includes a plan to launch 6 other corridors by 2030. In 2015, C40 played a key role in working with the Addis-Ababa Transport Programs Management Office (TPMO) in developing the BRT\u2019s Public Engagement, Branding and Communications Strategy and workplan. A grant of close to 1 million Euro has since been secured to implement this comprehensive strategy and other technical functions towards the successful realization of the BRTB2 Project. Three key stakeholder engagement actions have taken place since 2015.",

The pilot program, implemented from 2008-2010, resulted in overall energy cost savings of $1.3 million per year over 7 years against a total investment of $9 million. 146,000m2 of building space was retrofitted, resulting in a reduction of 7,000 tons of carbon emissions and a 28% reduction in energy consumption. Under the RE-FIT program, a public-sector building manager identifies a portfolio of buildings for retrofit and sets a target percentage of savings and a payback period. Then, prequalified ESCOs within the framework bid on the project. The winning bidder carries out and guarantees the retrofit., transferring the delivery risk to the ESCO. It\u2019s estimated that the RE-FIT program allows public sector owners to undertake large-scale retrofits six times faster than if they had carried out their own projects. Over 35 public sector organizations in London have signed an MOU committing them to use RE-FIT. Some example projects include the University of London, Kew Gardens, and the London Fire Brigade.",

The Cashback Scheme provided around 4,000 homeowners and private landlords with $500 cashback to replace boilers operating at less than 70% efficiency with new boilers operating at more than 90% efficiency and outfitted with better controls. The scheme used mayoral funds at the outset to leverage a further $13 million from the private sector to create deeper CO2 reductions and help achieve the mayor\u2019s target of becoming a zero-carbon city by 2050. The Better Boilers scheme specifically targets the most vulnerable communities in London and is in response to rising numbers of fuel-poor citizens in the capital.",

The site is an interchange station with six London Underground lines, two national train stations, and an international high-speed rail connecting to Paris. The planning process took six years to design and negotiate, and four rounds of public consultation involving around 30,000 people, leading to a well- tailored solution for urban regeneration. Construction of the Channel Tunnel Rail Link made about 20 hectares of the underused land available for high-density commercial development as well as housing provision around King\u2019s Cross\u2013St. Pancras. About 27 hectares of the land is planned to contain more than 1,900 homes, 23 new and refurbished office buildings, 500,000 square feet (about 47,000 square meters) of shops and restaurants, 20 new streets, and 10 major new public spaces for a projected 45,000 people. While the majority of private floor space will be allocated to produce business profits, more than 40 percent of the redeveloped former brownfield site will be used for public purposes, and across from the redevelopment site 20 historic buildings will be restored for modern use.",

Principal uses include 3.4 million square feet (316,000 sq m) of office space, 2,000 residential units, 500,000 square feet (46,400 sq m) of retail and leisure space, a hotel, and educational facilities. The site is served directly by six London Underground lines, two national mainline train stations, and an international high-speed rail connecting to Paris. Housing was an important ingredient in gaining planning approval for the regeneration. The need for additional homes, particularly affordable housing, with good transport links, was a key principle of the mayor\u2019s strategy at the time, and King\u2019s Cross was identified as a strategic housing site. Of the 2,000 homes on site, 42 percent will be affordable. The development\u2019s affordable housing partner is One Housing Group.

One of the city\u2019s main concerns is maintaining a secure and sustainable supply of fresh water, especially as Thames Water, the main water utility for London, estimates that without action, demand for water will exceed supply by 213 million litres of water per day by 2025. This deficit reflects a combination of the expected increasing demand for water from a growing population, the projected decreasing availability of rainfall in warmer, drier summers due to climate change, and need to integrate the European legislative requirement to protect unsustainable water abstractions. The city government is working closely with Thames Water on a twin-track programme to balance supply and demand for water through improving the water efficiency of existing properties while seeking new climate-resilient water resources.",

The restriction on groundwater extraction, decreed by regional regulation, is a key measure for slowing down land subsidence. The Northern Jakarta area is mandated to have 100% water-supply coverage and 0% groundwater abstraction by 2015. The rest of the city will also see groundwater extraction phased out in geographic bands moving southward by 2020, 2025 and 2030, with the similar assumption that piped water will be provided in all districts by 2030. This initiative is co-financed by taxing groundwater consumption and is supported by development of alternate water supply piping for large industrial users or relocation of large groundwater users outside the \u2018critical zones\u2019, but it admittedly still faces some challenges of proper enforcement. Other initiatives include construction of East Flood Canal and interconnection canals; Jakarta Emergency Dredging Initiative\u00a0of vital waterways (currently at 30% capacity partly due to clogging by high volume of improperly disposed solid waste); reconstruction of pumps; protection of natural coastal defences (mangroves); construction of sea embankments; and resettlement of illegal housing along rivers and lakes.",

                "description": "To cope with increased rates of flooding and to protect its poorest citizens, Indonesia\u2019s bustling capital city provides low-cost housing to the 400,000 citizens who reside along the city\u2019s waterfront in informal housing. With the land free of settlement, the city will revitalize the nearby water bodies, increase the water retention ability of the land, and boost reservoir capacity, thus reducing the risks of floods while protecting citizens. By the end of 2014, Jakarta had already built more than 14,000 low-cost apartment units, 13% of its goal of 52,656, which it hopes to accomplish by 2017. Units come furnished and are rent-free for the first six months, after which families are responsible for paying $22 per month. City officials consulted with residents face-to-face and involved them in the planning process to ensure that relocation is dignified. The new housing units will provide residents with safer, cleaner housing that will improve the livelihoods of tenants and alleviate environmental stress on the land they formerly occupied.",

It has an absolute cap of 6% for the first compliance period (FY2010-FY2014) and will have a 17% cap for the second compliance period (FY2015-FY2019). During the first compliance period, the reduction obligation rate was 8% for the commercial sector, including office buildings, and 6% for the industrial sector, including factories. Facilities can reduce emissions by themselves or acquire credits by trading to accomplish their obligations. Facility owners are required to submit their reduction plan and emissions report verified by third-party verification agencies every year. This program has seen significant success when compared to the Japan national average, and the program achieved a 26% reduction in emissions in FY2015http://www.kankyo.metro.tokyo.jp/en/climate/cap_and_trade.html",

It has an absolute cap of 6% for the first compliance period (FY2010-FY2014) and will have a 17% cap for the second compliance period (FY2015-FY2019). During the first compliance period, the reduction obligation rate was 8% for the commercial sector, including office buildings, and 6% for the industrial sector, including factories. Facilities can reduce emissions by themselves or acquire credits by trading to accomplish their obligations. Facility owners are required to submit their reduction plan and emissions report verified by third-party verification agencies every year. This program has seen significant success when compared to the Japan national average, and the program achieved a 25% reduction in emissions in FY2014",

The owners of new buildings of 5,000 m2 or larger are obligated to submit Green Building Plans which are then evaluated and publicly disclosed by TMG. It gives the building owners good incentives to develop energy efficient and environment-friendly buildings and as the result, the number of good environmental performance buildings is increasing in Tokyo. Tokyo is stepping into the era of green building.\nhttp://www.kankyo.metro.tokyo.jp/en/climate/build.html\n\nEnergy-efficiency certificate\n   Buildings exceeding a total floor erea of 10,000m2, excluding condominiums, TMG introduced the Energy-efficiency certificate program.  With this system, TMG imposes a requirement on building owners to provide their energy-efficiency certificate to purchasers, tenantss or other related parties of expanded or newly constructed buildings and to ensure energy-efficiency standards are met.\nTokyo Metropolian Condominium Environmental Performance Labelling System\n   For new construction and expansion work of buildings with total floor area exceeding 5,000m2, which are subject to Tokyo Green Buildin Program, and unclude residential areas with a total floor area of 2,000 m2 or over,, TMG imposes a requirement for the display of a label indicating the environmental efficiency of the condominium in advertisements for their sale or lease.  The label indicated a rating in the following areas using a three-star system, insulation perfirmance, enery efficiency, installation of solar energy equipments, extention of the operating life of the buildin, and green and water coverage.",

                "description": "The City of Tokyo lies largely below the flood level of its three main rivers, has high annual rainfall and is vulnerable to storm surges, earthquakes and tsunamis. Climate change is projected to increase peak river discharge and frequencies (peak discharge currently up to 100 times higher compared to minimum discharge), raise high tide and increase typhoon size, and exacerbate the impacts of potential earthquakes and tsunamis due to higher sea level. Thus, extreme floods are expected to occur more frequently in the future. To respond to the multitude of risks, Tokyo has developed the concept of a super levee. A super levee is a robust broad river embankment resistant to overflow, seepage and even earthquakes, thanks to special seismic reinforcement. It mainly differs from a conventional dyke by its width (a 10 m high super levee will be about 300 m wide). Super levees are well suited for dense urban areas, allowing for urban development on its top, integrating multifunctional structures and, compared to traditional levees, allowing easy access to rivers and reconnection with urban water ecosystems. For instance, the super levee built along Tokyo\u2019s Ara River combines a broad dyke with a park and a small high-rise, whereas the Sumida River super levee combines a broad dyke/flood-wall with a promenade and a large high-rise.",

                "description": "For several years, redevelopment of the area faced numerous obstacles. The East Futako-Tamagawa District Urban Redevelopment Committee was formed to undertake redevelopment efforts through community consensus. Tokyu Corporation remodeled the Futako Tamagawa station in 1997 and the project plan for development of the area on eastside of the station was finalized in 2000 . One of the largest urban redevelopment projects in Tokyo, the key mechanism adopted for redevelopment of Den-en-toshi Line and Futako-Tamagawa Station refers to internalization of accessibility and aggregation effect, market-driven redevelopment strategy, and inclusive long-term redevelopment plan with integration of transportation, commercial center and a high-quality living environment . With Phase-I (including two shopping centers, one 16-floor office building, five residential buildings and 1,033 apartments) completed in 2011, and Phase-II (comprising of two commercial buildings, a hotel, cinema complex and new public park) in 2015, the redevelopment around Futako Tamagawa Station reflects Tokyu Corporation\u2019s new strategy and key approaches to recent and projected market trends . The development features a new center for commercial, residential, and leisure activities, with urban accessibility around the railway station and suburban amenities by the Tama River. The redevelopment has taken nearly 15 years, involving more than 200 landowners and tenants in inclusive and complex floor area reallocation procedures. Owning more than 95 percent of the property rights around the station, the corporation has made a real effort to integrate multiple objectives and functions into one redevelopment, so as to generate recurrent benefits through synergistic area management activities rather than temporary profits from speculation. The inner-city office spaces included in this mixed-use development target innovative industries and creative workers. The corporation has also differentiated the new shopping facilities for younger consumers from existing retail stores for elderly residents around the station, intending to generate commercial synergies rather than redistributive effects in the same station area. The project has provided a generous amount of new public facilities, such as a transit plaza, local roads, and parks, through an urban redevelopment scheme and has helped reduce load on the environment. It has also enhanced connectivity of districts through rail-integrated development, while creating a city identity with symbolic design.",

                "description": "The 3R Dream Plan\u00a02010-2025, adopted in January 2011, aims to \u201creduce garbage while continuing the separation and recycling of garbage, to deal with global warming and to reduce CO2\u00a0emissions; (and) to realize comfortable and liveable city where garbage is controlled by pursuing safe, secure, and stable garbage processing\u201d (3R Dream Plan, 2011). The Plan puts the cooperation between citizens, companies and the city government at the centre and encourages behaviour change in order to increase recycling and to reduce waste. The Yokohama 3R Dream Plan teaches manufacturers to use recycled and recyclable materials during production and urges businesses to sell eco-friendly products and services, which will lead to fewer resources imported and used and, ultimately, wasted. Residents are encouraged through an extensive promotion and education campaign to participate by managing their household waste, reusing plastic bags and water bottles, and supporting environmentally friendly businesses. Residents invited to tens of thousands of resident briefings, as well as engaged through more than 2,000 campaigns at collection points and hundreds of campaigns at train stations.",

CO2 vehicle emissions are being reduced by 10% - a total of 2 million tons of CO2, delivering annual savings of $50 million USD in fuel costs. The improved air quality is also improving the health of residents, saving the City millions annually. The program works because it is applied during weekdays, which encourages people to use alternate modes of transport to and from work. A voluntary program where people choose one day a week (Monday to Friday) as a no driving day. Participants are given incentives, which are provided by public organisations and private companies, such as discounted petrol, free parking and car washing, to use alternate modes of transport of the selected days. Participants are encouraged to take part as often as they can. Those participating just three times a year, for example, will have their incentives removed or diminished.",

Consisting of both grey and green interventions, the program will repair drainage pipes under key corridors and repave streets and sidewalks with permeable pavement in order to prevent flooding during extreme weather events. Furthermore, corner extensions at intersections will improve pedestrian safety, and planting trees and green spaces will help the city manage rainwater, mitigate urban heat island effects, and serve as attractive public spaces. The project is financed by the city\u2019s bus rapid transit system, Metrobus, and aligns with the objectives of the larger, city-wide Comprehensive Mobility Program. As such, the project takes care to ensure that these newly renovated and redesigned streets are accessible and well-connected by adding and improving existing bicycle paths and integrating transit lines along these corridors.",

Although some of the most frequent impacts have been of hydrometeorological origin, geological phenomena, such as the 1985 earthquake, have caused the greatest economic and human losses. On a basis, there are other stresses that weaken the city, such as the inequality that exists at both a social and economic level as well as in the use of public space. For example, across the city, there is inequality of access to urban amenities and public services. Aquifer overexploitation is not just one of the most pressing and chronic issues affecting the future water supply for this region\u2019s population, it is also a determining factor for seismic exposure, which can result in differential subsidence. Climate change may exacerbate risks and potentially increase the intensity of hydrometeorological events, causing historically unprecedented heat waves, extreme rainfall events, and long droughts. . The CDMX Resilience Strategy is being developed as part of this initiative, and to address the challenges facing the city through five pillars, or guiding principles.

Mexico City already has an ambitious Climate Action Program calling for a 30% reduction in CO2 by 2020, but reducing emissions from existing, inefficient buildings is notoriously difficult. When done right, however, efficiency upgrades can be one of the cheapest ways to reduce emissions, as the pilot project at La Villa Pediatric Hospital demonstrates.

The corridor begins at the Iyana Ipaja terminal and traverses through major roundabouts, junctions and bus stops at Alaguntan, Moshalasi, Egbeda, Idimu, bus depot entrance at Ikotun, Igando road and terminates at Igando terminal. The first 10 km is a dual carriageway from Iyana Ipaja to Ikotun while the final 6 km is a single carriageway from Ikotun to Igando. An additional 10.9km tributary route [Maryland-Iyana Ipaja], originally identified in the Lagos BRT feasibility study was incorporated into the BFS infrastructure design. This tributary route connects BRT with the BFS corridor.

This road closure promotes more sustainable transport alternatives and is also used as a chance to create artistic, educational, and gastronomic activities for the city\u2019s citizens and tourists. It also serves as respite for the air pollution caused by traffic during the remainder of the month. To further encourage walking and cycling in the city, Lima offers free cycling workshops and has created additional cycle routes. And to determine the difference created by the scheme, the city regularly measures air particulates as well as noise levels. Particulate levels more than halved during one of the carfree days and noise levels fell from 78 to 59 decibels, creating a cleaner, calmer, and healthier environment for all to enjoy.",

Commercialization of solid waste is underway, which will ensure more waste is absorbed by the recycling industry, resulting in less extraction of natural resources and energy savings from avoided manufacturing of new materials. The project currently covers 42% of all the downtown district\u2019s housing, and the city aims to scale up to 100% of the population in the district and expand to include other sectors that generate solid waste as well. The project has also formalized the work of recyclers, increasing their income and improving their working conditions.",

Ten studies were completed across a range of coastal neighborhoods in the city which analyzed damage from Hurricane Sandy; risks from coastal storms, including 10-, 50-, and 100-year storms; flood elevations; wave threats; future floodplains; and sea level rise. Information from these studies will help shape how and where development occurs on vulnerable coastal land and protect the 71,500 buildings currently located along these shorelines.",

New York City is identifying vulnerable shorelines with comprehensive and detailed analyses, including data on daily high tide inundation, calculated using localized sea level rise projections from the New York City Panel on Climate Change (NPCC) and a wave atlas produced specifically for this project. Using the 90th percentile of projections for the 2050s produced by NPCC, projects were identified that will fortify vulnerable stretches of shoreline to prevent inundation of buildings and infrastructure in a future where the highest average level of the New York Harbor could rise by 81 cm. Analysis of New York City\u2019s more than 965 km of shoreline led to the selection of 15 projects that will make the city\u2019s coastline more resilient to the risks posed by sea level rise.",

New York City's government departments all have previously developed their own development guidance but lacked a consistent approach for how to use climate projections. The guidelines provide a consistent methodology for engineers, architects, and planners to design facilities that are resilient to continued changes in climate across the entire lifespan of the facilities. The Climate Resiliency Design Guidelines are multi-hazard, addressing all major climate change risks identified by the New York City Panel on Climate Change. The guidelines address some of New York\u2019s most acute issues, such as how to limit the urban heat island effect, while also protecting facilities against extreme heat. By recommending flexible adaptation pathways, a way of designing facilities with coastal storm protections that are upgradable, the city will limit urban flooding from extreme precipitation. In doing so, the city is not only becoming increasingly resilient but also a more enjoyable place to live for millions of New Yorkers.",

A case in point is the Saw Mill Creek marsh, a severely degraded wetland on Staten Island\u2019s west shore, which could have provided the absorptive capacity to mitigate much of the severe flooding that occurred during Hurricane Sandy in 2012. After the Hurricane, NYC lacked a sustainable funding source that it could draw on to restore this and many other degraded wetlands throughout the City. Healthy wetlands are needed to provide a resiliency buffer for coastline communities, many of which are disproportionately lower income than communities across the city at large. To address these issues, NYC introduced MARSHES, a citywide wetland mitigation banking program, which utilises one-time Federal recovery funding to perpetuate a sustainable and replicable program for wetland restoration and resiliency improvements across the city.",

                "description": "In 2016, the NextGeneration NYCHA Sustainability Agenda was developed as a 10-year roadmap for healthy and comfortable homes able to withstand the impacts of climate change, in addition to supporting the city\u2019s commitment to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2050. The plan outlines 17 strategies to reduce NYCHA\u2019s carbon footprint by 30% by 2025, foster resilience, and safeguard resident wellness, including improving heating and hot water efficiency, establishing standards for new buildings and improving existing buildings, adopting large-scale use of clean energy, and connecting residents to economic opportunity. Flood risk and stormwater management are a priority of the agenda, with resilience plans in development for all housing vulnerable to coastal flooding, including risk assessments and retrofit guidelines based on lessons learned from Hurricane Sandy. Phase one of the stormwater infrastructure implementation projects has the potential to capture approximately 72 million liters per year. Additionally, NYCHA will provide back-up power for all Sandyaffected developments, develop microgrids at certain developments, and install 25 MW of solar power in an effort to protect public housing residents from the short- and long-term impacts of climate change.",

To tackle this situation, New York City has set the goal to reduce the amount of waste disposed of by 90 % by 2030 from a 2005 baseline (around 3.6 million tons). It will also send zero waste to landfill by that point, which will also contribute to reaching the target of 80% reduction in GHG emissions by 2050 compared with 2005, introduced in 2014 and reaffirmed in OneNYC (April 2015), the City\u2019s sustainable and resilient plan.",

                "description": "It has been two years since the city of Los Angeles launched a major public works project to retrofit the city\u2019s street lighting with energy-efficient LED (lightemitting diode) fixtures, making this a good opportunity to assess progress. The project is still the largest LED street lighting retrofit ever undertaken globally; its implementation is ahead of schedule and the energy cost savings are surpassing original projections, largely due to continued improvements in the energy efficiency of LED technology. The project is a collaboration between the Los Angeles Bureau of Street Lighting; the Los Angeles Mayor\u2019s Office; the Department of Water & Power; and the Clinton Climate Initiative (CCI) Cities Program, which is now a fully integrated partner with the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40). Targeting 140,000 of the city\u2019s more than 209,000 street lights, the objectives of the retrofit project are to enhance the quality of municipal street lighting, reduce light pollution, improve street safety, and save both energy and money. The city budgeted $57 million for the project, to be carried out over a five-year period. Upon full implementation, the project is expected to return an estimated $10 million in energy and maintenance cost savings to the city while avoiding at least 40,500 tons of CO2 emissions each year.",

As the first project of its kind in the world, the pilot will double car-sharing in the city, initially placing 100 shared-use EVs and 200 charging stations in disadvantaged communities in and around Central Los Angeles. Within three years, the project aims to recruit 7,000 new users, who are expected to sell or avoid purchasing 1,000 private vehicles. By putting EVs and infrastructure in low-income neighborhoods and providing a subsidy to encourage their use, the city is helping increase access to economic opportunities while also promoting behavior change, eco-friendly mobility options, and improved air quality.",

To deliver on this vision, the city has introduced the Climate Change Strategic Framework (CCSF). The purpose of the CCSF is to strengthen the city\u2019s organization in its delivery on climate change action across sectors internally in the municipality and between communities, businesses, and citizens in the city. As part of the CCSF, Johannesburg aims to mainstream climate action in the city. Measuring greenhouse gas emissions will take a bottom-up approach, with a joint effort between the municipality\u2019s departments as well as from business and communities. The city will make use of C40\u2019s modeling tool \u201cCURB,\u201d which helps cities and local climate planners better understand the energy and emission implications of different low-carbon interventions in order to implement those most appropriate for Johannesburg. In doing so, Johannesburg hopes to see a unified city working towards a greener and more resilient future together.",

The city plans to build high-density housing, offices, social facilities, and retail along its revitalized transport corridors \u2013 the Corridors of Freedom \u2013 enabling residents to have shorter, more enjoyable commutes, without using private motorized transport. Implementing a low-emissions bus rapid transit (BRT) system will offer fast, safe, and affordable mobility, and increase employment opportunities for residents living far from central city areas. With transportation responsible for 25% of the city\u2019s total emissions, Johannesburg is a big emitter of greenhouse gases, contributing 56% of emissions in South Africa. Johannesburg therefore aims to replace old minibus taxi fleets with cleaner buses using alternative fuels. As an incentive, taxi owners handing over their vehicles \u2013 which 585 owners have done to date \u2013 are granted shares in the company operating the new BRT system. The city makeover is estimated to reduce CO2 emissions by 1.6 million tons by 2020.",

The project currently supplies 1.1 MW of electricity to the Northern Water Treatment plant, the largest in the city, which is equivalent to 12% of the plant\u2019s operational needs. The city plans to expand the project to four other wastewater plants. In addition, to further scale up this solution, Johannesburg will partner with an energy management services company to develop biodigestors that will process organic waste from the city\u2019s five landfills, turning it into biogas used to fuel the city\u2019s bus fleet",

Entrepreneurship is stimulated in the communities by establishing waste buy-back centers, which are operated by communities. The centers buy recyclable waste such as paper, plastic, cans, and glass from people and then sell it to recyclers. Waste collectors receive a direct cash payment according to the volume of cleaned waste they bring in. An important aspect of the initiative is the incorporation of the informal waste collectors. Without the buy-back centers matching supply and demand, waste collectors would have to travel long distances by foot to sell waste. The aim is to empower impoverished communities via business entity ownership and increased recycling rates. There are seven buy-back centers spread across the city, each of which employs 10 to 15 full-time staff as well as 30 more people who indirectly benefit from the centers.",

A dedicated Solar Water Heater Accreditation Programme has been established by the City which accredits a set of quality service providers and products, and inspects installations in order to improve households\u2019 trust. A media campaign, website, posters, publications, exhibitions and events are targeted at higher-usage electricity consumers. It offers tips and financial savings information for saving electricity; and information about energy saving technologies.For the commercial sector, the Energy Efficiency Forum  was established in 2009 as a pioneering public-private initiative by the City of Cape Town in partnership with Eskom and the South African Property Owners Association (SAPOA). The Forum is a platform for practical knowledge sharing and collective action, targeted to assist owners and managers of commercial buildings and operations. It meets 3 times a year, and offers case studies, an annual award programme and updates on financing options, innovations, policy and training/ support opportunities.",

Critical to the development of the set-back line was the fact that no legislation in South Africa had previously been designed to resolve and manage existing at-risk infrastructure \u2013 both natural and man-made. The implementation of the Coastal Set-back Line will be used to enhance other regulatory mechanisms within the city that address climate change risks.

With the project, the city\u2019s Solid Waste Management Department embarked on its first closed-loop procurement scheme between a public authority and a private manufacturer. Launched in 2014, the Fifty/50 Wheelie Bin program utilizes 50% virgin material and 50% old bins that have been recycled, rather than using solely 100% virgin high-density polyethylene (HDPE). This has been identified as a safe ratio of virgin and recycled plastics based on months of research and development.",

WISP targets the diversion of all industrial waste from landfill, complementing the city\u2019s zero waste to landfill activities. The program also focuses on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, generating financial benefits for companies and creating jobs. WISP has an enterprise development program, which creates new businesses via an incubation program linking entrepreneurs to raw material supply agreements. Workshops have identified more than 4,000 potential synergies between the 486 companies that are part of the WISP network. WISP has also developed an international standard carbon calculator to measure emissions savings from materials saved from landfilling and emissions avoided in producing and transporting new raw materials. Over the next three years, WISP synergies are expected to generate 64,500 metric tons in CO2 equivalent savings.",

The extensive program targets both technical and behavioral changes, including public awareness campaigns about water use efficiency, the introduction of a water tariff designed to encourage water savings, the promotion of the use of recycled water for irrigation, as well as a range of technical interventions to minimize water losses. Particularly vital and socially inclusive elements include offering free plumbing repairs for low-income households and training \u201ccommunity plumbers.\u201d More than 4,000 households have been visited for leak detections and repairs, and 258 km of water pipes have been replaced in order to reduce pipe bursts and water leaks. So far, the program has been a success, as water demand hasgrown at an average of 1.78% compared to an average growth of more than 4% before implementation. This is despite population growth of more than 30% between 2001 and 2011.",

In a learning-by-doing approach, the city has installed 300 kW of PV on five municipal buildings. The lessons learned from these initial projects will feed into future policy developments and installations as the city adds to its solar portfolio on the 2,000 available municipal buildings. In order to encourage solar uptake more widely, the city created the first African PV mapping tool, enabling residents and businesses to calculate the PV potential of their roof, estimate savings, payback time, and find a local installer. Additionally, they are developing an online short course about renewable energy as well as an educational website for people to learn more about the potential of solar technology.",

Ten interrelated climate change response themes were identified through the strategy development process: Water; Sea level rise; Biodiversity; Food security; Health; Energy; Waste and pollution; Transport; Economic development; and Knowledge generation and understanding. A set of goals, objectives and responses was developed for each theme. ",

The project intended not only to prioritize and revive the image of public transport in the city, but also the image of BRT system in the country. It is the first BRT system in India to have dedicated bus corridor, median stations with off-board ticketing facility and a central command and control center to manage day-to-day bus operations on real time basis. Passengers buy tickets before entering system stations where they can quickly board the buses. Beyond its physical design, Janmarg is the first system in India to implement institutional and contractual changes that are crucial to the fundamental delivery of BRT.",

In addition, almost all bike city trips do not include other transport modes, critically limiting combined bike-bus travel over large distances. Intermodality is used only for suburban trips involving only the train station and the main bus station, which are located in the same place. This results in a very congested area creating a difficult and uncomfortable shift in modal transport.\nThis measure mainly consisted in research studies and demo activities that as a precursor to the launch of the Brescia metro line, opened in 2013. The integration of several innovative systems: bike-sharing network, automatic light metro line, train and bus services is one of the measure's most innovative aspects.\nAnother innovative aspect of the measure involved the use of different modelling techniques (macro and micro) to define strategic choices about the future public transport network. This methodological approach aimed to support the reorganisation of the local public transport once the new metro line is launched. The macro-simulation regarded the new public transport network scenarios, while the micro-simulation evaluated the quality of public spaces close to the new metro stations.",

Routes could then be designed taking into account the demands of cyclists as well as safety requirements, and creating a complete network from the various unconnected sections. Following a study of the state and use of bicycle parking facilities, new infrastructure was installed.\u00a0 Educational and marketing campaigns were then implemented, including a poster design competition. Some 230 new bike racks were installed, Campaigns were implemented to encourage mutual respect between pedestrians and cyclists, and An additional 15 km of bike lanes were developed, making a total of 48 km of safe bike lanes in the city. This means that Burgos is the fifth city in Spain in terms of length of cycle lanes. ",

Fossil fuel-based building systems, such as boilers and furnaces, will need be phased out and replaced with clean and renewable energy sources. High-efficiency electric air source heat pumps and heat pump water heaters offer a cleaner alternative to typical oil- and gas-fired building systems. These technologies use electricity, which can be increasingly powered by renewable energy, instead of fossil fuels to provide heat. The Building Electrification Initiative empowers cities with tools to accelerate the transition to clean and high efficiency heating for buildings.They also provide high-efficiency cooling for buildings, which is another key benefit as cities face increasingly extreme heat due to climate change.",

The projects aim to provide better access of cycle rickshaws to the residents of Fazilka and Chandigarh by means of direct dial-a-rickshaw facility, to support the livelihood of cycle rickshaw operators and to protect the environment. The main priority is to link demand for cycle rickshaws and its supply with latest information technology tools and real time technology. For example, in Fazilka city, five Ecocab call centers are established within the city at strategic locations to provide dial-arickshaw facility. Each centre within its zone of influence has around 1500 households. To cut down the time required for providing cycle rickshaws, these centers are strategically placed along with the network of 20 feeder sub centers so that after a phone call within 10 minutes Ecocab shall reach the desired location.20 With average trip length of three to four kilometers in Fazilka, cycle rickshaws are providing mobility to significant segment of population. The success of the Fazilka initiative led to the Chandigarh (which is a larger city) initiative. This initiative was developed after the Punjab and Haryana High Court directed city officials to introduce eco-cabs in many cities including Chandigarh. The Graduates Welfare Association Fazilka, an NGO, has launched the service in Chandigarh along with a few volunteers from Chandigarh and support of the municipal corporation and Chandigarh administration.",

The projects aim to provide better access of cycle rickshaws to the residents of Fazilka and Chandigarh by means of direct dial-a-rickshaw facility, to support the livelihood of cycle rickshaw operators and to protect the environment. The main priority is to link demand for cycle rickshaws and its supply with latest information technology tools and real time technology. For example, in Fazilka city, five Ecocab call centers are established within the city at strategic locations to provide dial-arickshaw facility. Each centre within its zone of influence has around 1500 households. To cut down the time required for providing cycle rickshaws, these centers are strategically placed along with the network of 20 feeder sub centers so that after a phone call within 10 minutes Ecocab shall reach the desired location.20 With average trip length of three to four kilometers in Fazilka, cycle rickshaws are providing mobility to significant segment of population. The success of the Fazilka initiative led to the Chandigarh (which is a larger city) initiative. This initiative was developed after the Punjab and Haryana High Court directed city officials to introduce eco-cabs in many cities including Chandigarh. The Graduates Welfare Association Fazilka, an NGO, has launched the service in Chandigarh along with a few volunteers from Chandigarh and support of the municipal corporation and Chandigarh administration.",

Similarly, slum settlements have been overwhelmingly built in sensitive watershed areas. The project, rooted in Goi\u00e2nia\u2019s Master Plan and Municipal Housing Policy, aimed to improve the quality of life for these 7,000 families using social (education, counseling and training programmes), physical (housing and infrastructure provision, and environmental recuperation), and legal (land tenure legislation) interventions.",

With this dimension to the process, recharging can be managed efficiently through service providers that smooth demand of recharging and battery swapping by directing the flow of vehicles to facilities with low traffic throughout the day. The City of Hangzhou\u2019s goal is to reach a total fleet of 1,000 taxis, with 500 already delivered. With the uptake of 1,000 EV taxis, Hangzhou\u2019s road transportation system will be one step closer to achieving a zero-emission outcome",

The CAP offers direction in the form of reference material and a recommended implementation strategy, but does not attempt to specifically design programs or policies. Of the nine strategies presented in the CAP, two strategies focus on reducing emissions from transportation and three strategies address emissions reductions from building energy use. One strategy focuses on reducing waste-related emissions, and one on maximizing carbon sequestration within the City. A future version of the CAP will contain a strategy on climate change adaptation, which will include actions necessary to address rising sea level. At the time of this writing, the Hayward Area Shoreline Planning Agency had not yet released its sea level rise study. The remaining strategy focuses on community outreach and education. ",

The charrette gathered the input of various building experts, who concluded that the City-County Building had great potential for a deep energy retrofit, energy cost savings and attractive financial returns. The city issued a request for proposal to several ESCOs, and Performance Services was chosen to carry out the deep retrofit and a set of other energy conservation measures in other city/county facilities. In addition to the rest of the retrofit design, Performance Services identified a radical way to leverage large amounts of groundwater (over 10,000 gal/hour), which had previously been being pumped away from the building due to a high water table, to reduce heating and cooling costs. The project began in 2010 and was completed in 2 years for $2 million. The city financed the project with a finance lease and guaranteed the savings with Performance Services.

The city plans to improve planning and management of public transport based on efficient monitoring systems to encourage increased usage, as well as introduce new modes and routes for urban mobility. With the development of a combination of policies, the city created a first-of-its-kind mobility model in Russia. The city has used federal and regional funds to leverage investment from the private sector, too. So far, Kaliningrad has procured 145 efficient EURO-5 buses with lower particulate emissions, which replaced 200 old buses with smaller passenger capacity. The city has also constructed 15 km of bike lanes and constructed more strategic parking spaces throughout the city. The old tram network is also being upgraded, with larger electric trolley buses replacing the small and clunky trams.",

Targeting 1 million people across six boroughs and covering over 65 km2 of land on the western bank of the River Ganges, the project focuses on recycling, composting organic waste, burying inert waste, and treating septic sludge. The project takes an engineering approach, through the development of infrastructure, but also incorporates a soft approach, including an eight year mass awareness program, ensuring community participation. A common Regional Waste Management Centre, which houses a sanitary landfill, leachate treatment plant, and septic tank sludge treatment plant, as well as five composting centers, have been constructed, as part of the project. Eventually, the ambitious project aims to reduce open dumping and waste burning by 100% and achieve 100% waste segregation at the source. In addition, the project will monitor air quality, reduce the concentration of landfill methane, and preserve groundwater within 50 m of the periphery of the Regional Waste Management Centre. Since the program launched, the rate of segregation has increased by up to 80%.",

The CAP sets emission reduction goals for 2020, 2030, and 2050 according to California AB 32, the Urban Environmental Accords (UEA), and Executive Order S-3-05. The CAP also outlines progress made toward the goals of the U.S. Mayors Climate Protection Agreement (MCPA) and the UEA, to which the City became a signatory in 2007. Finally, the CAP identifies existing activities that contribute to local climate adaptation and priority steps for adaptation planning. The City of Monterey CAP is a living document - community members, business owners, and public employees should continue to reference and provide input to the CAP to improve the plan and integrate its attributes into City planning.",

The mopeds are called upon by a text message or telephone call and arrive within five minutes. They operate in zones and are controlled via geo-fencing (using GPS to define a geographical boundary) from a control center with 24/7 surveillance. Fares are integrated and those that use the authorized mopeds receive discounts on the central bus system. During high demand, the free service is conducted with mini-vans, and the city is testing a prototype ramped bus to connect with schools and other destinations.\n\nOne of the most innovative features of Yipi is that it includes an affirmative action driver recruitment policy that prioritizes local neighborhood women, who can work in their own communities with flexible hours, allowing them to balance work with household needs. It also makes the system more trustworthy, especially for women, in contrast to private moto-taxis, operated by young men, which have earned a reputation for insecurity and danger.",

In 1998, the Moshi Urban Water and Sewerage Authority (MUWSA), was established as one of the first autonomous \"Urban Water and Sewerage Authorities\" (UWSAs) when Tanzania started to decentralize its water management system in the late 1990s. MUWSA is a fully autonomous but government owned organization with tariff-setting powers responsible for provision of clean and safe water, and collection and disposal of wastewater. It is supervised by a board appointed by the Tanzanian government but also nominated by local authorities and stakeholder groups. MUWSA operates as a commercially run organization that works closely to its consumers. Since MUWSA was formed, it has transformed an aged infrastructure with a low number of household connections and frequent interruptions to a system that delivers clean, safe and affordable water to more than 95% of its residents, almost 24 hours a day. It has improved its efficiency, reduced water leakage, increased the number of paying customers, and as a result improved its economy. MUWSA has also built a sewerage network serving around 30% of the population, far higher than other Tanzanian cities. The remaining population uses onsite sanitation - pit latrines and septic tank systems.",

Starting in 2014, when Nanjing held the Youth Olympic Games, they increased their electric bus orders: 650 from BYD and 408 from Nanjing Kinglong. Nanjing plans to promote an additional 500 electric buses in 2016, and has outlined a subsidy to support new energy vehicle adoption. Nanjing has one major bus operator, Nanjing Public Transportation Group (with five full stake companies, including Yangzi Public Transportation company, and two other bus companies, one station company, one ferry company and four partially owned companies); each of the sub-companies has different battery electric fleets. The charging station was built by Nanjing Kinglong and another bus manufacturer. The pilot ultimately failed because the charging station (swap) could meet demand, and had maintenance issues.",

Allocation of development rights would also be contingent on transportation performance meeting certain non-auto mode share targets. The County also plans to provide many of the public amenities through public-private partnerships, such as the recent inclusion of a public school in the approved plans for the White Flint Mall.

The measure resulted in upgraded bus shelters at approximately 150 stops, and improved information and accessibility. It also included a security audit and a \u201cSafer Routes to Bus Stops\u201d programme, with management systems for the monitoring and maintenance of cleaner stops and quality shelters.

Regulations covering energy efficiency standards in buildings, heating energy consumption limits, and financial incentives have all been put in place to help the city on its low-carbon transition. More than $550 million has been invested in renewable energy systems and building retrofits since 2012, more than half of which came from public funds. Combining energy efficiency with renewable investment is not a groundbreaking strategy for reducing emissions, but when it comes to heating, the city is pursuing a truly innovative approach. Qingdao is investing $3.5 billion in a clean district heating network covering 180 km2 that will make use of air, ground, and waste-source heat pumps.

A forecast was made of business-as-usual emissions in the absence of any emissions reduction actions. This forecast was then adjusted to account for the emissions reduction expected from statewide policies and from actions that have already been taken by the City since the baseline inventory. In 2014, the City Council adopted emissions reduction goals for the CAP. For community-wide emissions, the reduction goal is 15% below the baseline year 2008 by 2020, and 30% below the baseline year 2008 by 2035.

The city has so far built around 100 rainwater harvesting systems, both on a household and communal scale and some for school buildings. Providing clean water to poorer communities will also reduce groundwater exploitation that speeds up land subsidence. In cooperation with government agencies, experts, and other stakeholders, Semarang has developed a flood early warning system which includes evacuation plans and flood shelters. It reduces climate change vulnerability and disaster risk, and enables the community to prepare measures to reduce damages. The Public Works Agency is now better informed about areas where infrastructure capacity needs to be strengthened in order to minimize the flood impact. The continuing work on a sea wall with mangrove planting goes back to 2002 and has already reclaimed half of 196 hectares of lost fishponds. The national project of the Jatibarang dam, started in 2014, is expected to reduce flooding, improve the drainage system and deal with the problem of clean water as limited water supply leads to uncontrolled exploitation of groundwater that in turn speeds up subsidence.",

The process evaluated 12 essential community sectors, such as drinking water, electricity, transportation, and stormwater, and scored them based on their adaptive capacity. Results indicated, for example, that housing and public safety are the least adaptive sectors, and that drinking water, transportation, and public safety should be considered for prioritized funding. The assessment also showcased the interdependencies between systems and the nature and magnitude of vulnerabilities.",

With its sights set on carbon neutrality by 2040, a bold yet achievable goal, the city must continue to challenge status quo energy usage and associated greenhouse-gas emissions. The Climate Action Plan (CAP) that follows begins with three kick-start projects to help spur clean energy changes in the community and build momentum for the implementation of this plan. This is followed by seven climate goals, supporting strategies, and specific initiatives and actions to help guide St. Louis Park toward intermediary progress by 2030. The purpose of setting goals to 2030 rather than 2040 is to get the city on a trajectory toward its carbon neutral goal and allow an interim point to examine progress and reassess its course of action. The CAP then outlines more aggressive, advanced strategies that are necessary for the achievement of carbon neutrality by 2040. The CAP concludes with guidance on how the city itself can strive to improve its climate impact to lead the community toward its collective goals.",

The LPG buses were marked with stickers and the routes designated as eco-routes were indicated with clear signposting. Bus drivers received training on eco-driving and good customer service. Secondary, narrower routes were identified and subcontracted to a private company operating minibuses. The refurbished bus fleet was promoted via a wide range of publicity activities. As a result of fleet renewal and the conversion of half the fleet to LPG rather than diesel, emissions of pollutants fell: carbon dioxide by 11 percent/year; carbon monoxide by 3 percent/year; nitrogen oxides by 15 percent/year; and particulates by 49 percent/year.",

The solar water heater ordinance was issued in 2006, and has led to an increase in installations. By 2012, Thane had solar water heaters with a combined capacity of more than 2 million liters per day (LPD), equivalent to approximately 20,000 small panels. In addition, the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) installed solar water heaters on hospitals and municipal buildings with a combined capacity of more than 100,000 LPD. Solar water heaters have great potential for energy savings in Thane and other Indian cities with their lower upfront costs. Thane has also invested in wind-solar hybrid systems and solar PVs for lighting & air-conditioning. It has built a 160 ton solar air conditioning plant and a 15 ton biomethanation plant, as well as solar PVs at municipal buildings. In the pipeline is a larger solar PV project, introducing net-metering, and a larger waste to energy project, that alone would meet the energy saving target of the solar city project.",

The action plan recommends cross-sector targets, including 75% of energy to be renewable and 100% of transportation to use zero-carbon energy by 2050; 100% of new buildings to be near-zero emissions by 2030; and 100% of existing buildings retrofitted by 2050. Toronto seeks to not only address climate change mitigation with these goals, but equally to focus on adapting the city, making it resilient against future impacts. When implemented, these accelerated actions are projected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 857,000 metric tons by 2020. TransformTO is Toronto\u2019s new and ambitious climate action strategy. TransformTO will reduce local greenhouse gas emissions, and improve our health, grow our economy, and improve social equity. \nIn July 2017 City Council unanimously approved a set of long-term, low-carbon goals, and strategies to reach them.",

Offered with no upfront costs and at a low interest rate, the loans target energy efficiency and water conservation upgrades in single-family houses and rental apartment buildings. Crucially, the cost of improvements is repaid over time via fixed installments linked to the property tax bill, meaning the loan is tied to the land not the owner, in case of sale. The program also has equity considerations, as owners\u2019 eligibility is not dependent on traditional credit ratings but their rate of municipality repayment. So far, $5.4 million in low-interest loans have been committed to 111 energy projects. The programs\u2019 \u201cone-window\u201d service makes the process as easy and streamlined as possible for participants, allowing access to utility incentives, energy advisors, and customer support in addition to financing. Furthermore, HELP and Hi-RIS are self-sustaining financially and do not impact the city\u2019s taxpayers, as about 60% of the operating budget has been raised from third-party sources and the remainder is recovered directly from program participants through an administrative fee.",

The $1.5 million project retrofitted three public school buildings serving ger settlements in Ulaanbaatar. These schools were chosen due to being in rapidly growing areas, serving low income populations, and requiring building condition improvements. All this is an effective way to showcase the retrofits and increase the learning potential about the benefits of thermal rehabilitation. The project was designed to increase energy efficiency use in the three school buildings and decrease coal consumption, coal costs, and coal-related GHG emissions.

The new waterbuses were accessible to disabled users, allowing them to reach their destination directly. The new boats are wider and offer a larger boarding space for wheelchairs, with a smaller height different between the docks and boarding area. These improvements offer better accessibility for people with disabilities and more comfortable, safer travel conditions. With the introduction of the new waterbuses, disabled passengers save more than two hours in winter and nearly one hour in summer on the journey to Murano Island from the bus terminal in Piazzale Roma. The new waterbuses also reduce the risk of environmental damage. Research carried out by the ACTV technical office in collaboration with the University of Trieste led to   improvements in the shape of the hull and in the boats\u2019 hydrodynamic performance, with a reduction in motion resistance of about 23 percent (at 20 km standard speed) and consequently lower wave resistance. There was also a considerable reduction in noise: at most points in the passenger area the reduction exceeds 10 db, thus passengers are able clearly to perceive the improvement.",

To improve air quality in the city the MIRACLES project encouraged the take-up of cleaner fuels and technologies and ran a campaign to raise awareness of the benefits of environmentally friendly vehicles. The main public transport operator in the area, Stagecoach, had a fleet of nearly 60 buses serving Winchester. Prior to MIRACLES, Stagecoach had already set up a rolling programme to upgrade its fleet to Euro II emissions standard, but in partnership with Hampshire County Council it was decided, through MIRACLES, that this should be extended to meet the Euro III standards introduced in 2001.  The Quality Bus Partnership was agreed between MIRACLES and Stagecoach in September 2003. In November 2003, 13 new Euro III buses were added to the Winchester fleet. Through the partnership, an ongoing programme of retrofitting was agreed for the Winchester bus fleet to bring all mid-life vehicles up to Euro III standard or better. Clean-up grants were applied for from the governmental organisation Energy Savings Trust in order to provide additional funding for the retrofitting programme.",

The pollution caused by the closed Jinkou landfill would have taken decades to remove through natural degradation, affecting not only the environment but also residents in nearby areas. To restore this wasteland more efficiently and cost-effectively, the city began an aerobic ecological restoration project,\u00a0which restored more than 52 hectares of land for city landscaping (increased land values and economic development in surrounding areas) and saved $125 million compared to conventional restoration methods.\u00a0The landfill site restoration process, which began in 2014, introduced proper planting techniques, diverse plants, and measures to improve the soil. The project also ties in with Wuhan\u2019s General Urban Planning scheme (2010-2020), which aims to improve the quality of the city\u2019s ecological environment and enhance sustainable urban development.",

To deal with the challenges listed above, the municipal government chose to invest in a system that involves pre-treating sludge using a high-temperature hydrolysis process, then co-digesting sludge and kitchen waste to generate methane and biochar.",

The 350 buses cost 0.35 billion RMB (1 million RMB per vehicle), and the city bus operators pay this back in 10 years. Because of national policy and city level policy to encourage electric buses, Yinlong caught the opportunity and has become one of the largest electric bus manufacturers in a few years. Also some say because of Yinlong\u2019s capacity, Zhuhai also became a city for a large fleet of electric buses. However, because of a recent fire on one battery electric bus, the safety of electric buses caused people\u2019s concern.",
